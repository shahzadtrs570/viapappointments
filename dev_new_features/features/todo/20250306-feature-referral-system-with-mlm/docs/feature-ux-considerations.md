## Overview

This document outlines the user experience considerations for the Referral System with MLM feature. It provides detailed guidance on the design, interaction patterns, and usability requirements for each key interface in the system. The goal is to ensure a seamless, intuitive experience that encourages user engagement with the referral program.

## General UX Principles

### Accessibility

- All interfaces must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Color contrast ratios must meet accessibility guidelines
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Screen reader compatibility is required for all components
- Text size should be adjustable without breaking layouts

### Responsiveness

- All interfaces must be fully responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Critical actions should be easily accessible on smaller screens
- Touch targets should be appropriately sized for mobile interactions
- Complex visualizations should adapt gracefully to smaller screens
- Performance optimization for mobile networks is essential

### Consistency

- Maintain consistent visual language across all interfaces
- Use established design patterns from the existing platform
- Ensure terminology is consistent throughout the experience
- Apply consistent interaction patterns for similar actions
- Follow the platform's design system guidelines

### Simplicity

- Prioritize clarity over complexity in all interfaces
- Break complex processes into manageable steps
- Use progressive disclosure for advanced features
- Provide clear, concise instructions and feedback
- Minimize cognitive load, especially for new users

### Design System

We will utilize ShadcnUI's component library which provides:
- Consistent visual language
- Dark mode support out of the box
- Accessible components
- Responsive design patterns
- Modern, clean aesthetics

### Component Examples

```tsx
// Example of a Referral Card Component
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardDescription,
  CardContent,
  CardFooter
} from "@package/ui/card"
import { Button } from "@package/ui/button"
import { Badge } from "@package/ui/badge"

export function ReferralCard({ referral }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Referral Details</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>Track your referral status and earnings</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <div className="space-y-1">
            <p className="text-sm font-medium">Referred User</p>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{referral.username}</p>
          </div>
          <Badge variant={referral.status === 'completed' ? 'success' : 'pending'}>
            {referral.status}
          </Badge>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <Button variant="outline" className="w-full">
          View Details
        </Button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  )
}

// Example of MLM Tree Visualization
import { ScrollArea } from "@package/ui/scroll-area"
import { TreeView } from "@package/ui/tree-view"

export function MLMTreeView({ data }) {
  return (
    <Card className="w-full">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Your MLM Network</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <ScrollArea className="h-[400px]">
          <TreeView data={data} />
        </ScrollArea>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

        {/* Additional tab content */}
      </Tabs>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. Referral Link Generation

```tsx
import { Input } from "@package/ui/input"
import { Button } from "@package/ui/button"

      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Your Referral Link</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>
          Share this link to earn rewards
        </CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="flex space-x-2">
          <Input value={referralLink} readOnly />
          <Button onClick={copyToClipboard}>
            Copy
          </Button>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

  return (
    <Card className="h-[600px]">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Your Network</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <ScrollArea className="h-[500px]">
          <NetworkGraph
            data={networkData}
            className="w-full"
            containerClassName="min-h-[1000px]"
          />
        </ScrollArea>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## Responsive Design

Utilize Tailwind CSS breakpoints for responsive layouts:

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4">
  {/* Responsive grid content */}
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 md:flex-row md:space-y-0 md:space-x-4">
  {/* Responsive flex content */}
</div>
```

## Loading States

Use ShadcnUI's built-in loading states:

```tsx
import { Skeleton } from "@package/ui/skeleton"

export function LoadingState() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <Skeleton className="h-12 w-full" />
      <Skeleton className="h-4 w-3/4" />
      <Skeleton className="h-4 w-1/2" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Error Handling

Implement error states using ShadcnUI components:

```tsx
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@package/ui/alert"

export function ErrorState({ error }) {
  return (
    <Alert variant="destructive">
      <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>
