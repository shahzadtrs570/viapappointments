# Survey Feature UX Considerations

## Overview
This document outlines the key user experience considerations for implementing the survey feature, focusing on both the admin (survey creator) and end-user (survey respondent) experiences.

## Admin Experience

### Survey Creation and Management

#### Survey Builder Interface
- **Intuitive Editor**: The survey builder should provide a visual, drag-and-drop interface for creating surveys without requiring technical knowledge
- **Real-time Preview**: Admin users should be able to preview their survey as they build it
- **Responsive Design Tools**: Provide tools to ensure the survey looks good on all device sizes
- **Template Library**: Include starter templates to accelerate survey creation
- **Save States**: Autosave functionality to prevent loss of work

#### Survey Management Dashboard
- **Clear Status Indicators**: Visual indicators showing survey status (draft, published, closed)
- **Usage Statistics**: Display key metrics like response count, completion rate, and average completion time
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Enable admins to find surveys quickly by status, creation date, and response rate
- **Bulk Operations**: Allow for actions on multiple surveys simultaneously
- **Search Functionality**: Provide search by title, description, or contents

#### Lead-Survey Connection Management
- **Visual Connection Builder**: Create an intuitive interface for connecting lead types to surveys
- **Rule Visualization**: Clearly display which lead types will receive which surveys
- **Conflict Detection**: Alert admins if rules could result in a lead receiving multiple surveys
- **Priority Management**: Intuitive interface for adjusting survey priority
- **Preview Mode**: Allow testing the rule system without creating actual leads

### Analytics and Reporting

#### Dashboard Design
- **Key Metrics at a Glance**: Important statistics visible immediately upon opening
- **Drill-down Capabilities**: Allow clicking on summary metrics to see more detailed information
- **Export Options**: Multiple formats for exporting data (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- **Visualization Variety**: Different chart types appropriate for different question types
- **Comparison Tools**: Compare results across time periods or between different surveys

#### Response Browser
- **Efficient Navigation**: Easy navigation between individual responses
- **Response Status Filtering**: Filter by complete/incomplete responses
- **Lead Connection**: Clear indication of which lead submitted the response when applicable
- **Timestamp Information**: Clear display of when the response was started and completed
- **Raw Data Access**: Option to view the raw JSON response data for technical users

## End-User Experience

### Survey Presentation

#### Visual Design
- **Clean, Distraction-free Interface**: Minimize visual clutter to focus on questions
- **Brand Consistency**: Support for customization to match organization branding
- **Accessible Design**: High contrast options, sufficient text size, and keyboard navigability
- **Mobile-first Approach**: Ensure surveys work well on small screens first
- **Loading States**: Clear indication when survey is loading or submitting

#### Navigation and Flow
- **Progress Indicator**: Clear indication of progress through multi-page surveys
- **Save and Continue**: Allow users to save progress and continue later
- **Previous/Next Controls**: Intuitive navigation between survey pages
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Support for navigation using keyboard
- **Section Headers**: Clear delineation between survey sections

#### Question Types and Interaction
- **Clear Instructions**: Each question should have clear instructions
- **Error Messaging**: Helpful error messages for validation failures
- **Input Accessibility**: Form controls should be accessible to all users
- **Touch-friendly Controls**: Large touch targets for mobile users
- **Inline Help**: Contextual help for complex questions

### Lead-to-Survey Transition

#### Flow Design
- **Seamless Transition**: The flow from lead form to survey should feel natural and connected
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain context about why the survey is being presented
- **Skip Option**: Clear option to skip the survey without feeling penalized
- **Progress Transparency**: Set expectations about survey length
- **Return Path**: Clear way to return to original context after survey completion

#### Completion Experience
- **Confirmation Message**: Clear indication that the survey was successfully submitted
- **Thank You Screen**: Customizable thank you message
- **Next Steps**: Clear guidance on what happens next
- **Redirection Options**: Configurable redirection after completion
- **Sharing Options**: Allow users to share the survey with others if appropriate

## Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG Compliance
- Ensure all survey components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Support screen readers through proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigability throughout the entire survey experience
- Provide sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements
- Allow for zooming and text resizing without breaking layouts

### Inclusive Design
- Support for right-to-left languages
- Consideration for color-blind users in visualization and UI design
- Support for slow internet connections with appropriate loading states
- Low-bandwidth options (text-only mode) where feasible
- Device-agnostic design that works across various screen sizes and input methods

## Performance Considerations

### Loading Times
- Initial survey load should be under 2 seconds
- Lazy loading of survey pages for multi-page surveys
- Optimize images and assets used in surveys
- Implement skeleton screens for elements that take longer to load
- Use appropriate caching strategies for survey definitions

### Response Time
- Question interactions should feel immediate
- Form submission should provide immediate feedback
- Page transitions should be smooth and quick
- Minimize layout shifts during loading and submission
- Implement offline support for survey completion when possible

## User Testing Recommendations

- Conduct usability testing with representative users for both admin and end-user interfaces
- A/B test different survey layouts and flows to optimize completion rates
- Collect feedback specifically on the lead-to-survey transition experience
- Test on various devices, connection speeds, and accessibility tools
- Implement analytics to track drop-off points in the survey flow for continuous improvement
