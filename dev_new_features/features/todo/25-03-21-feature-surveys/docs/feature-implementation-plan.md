## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Complex database schema changes | Medium | High | Thorough testing of migrations, backup database before applying |
| SurveyJS API changes | Low | Medium | Lock dependency versions, review changelogs before updates |
| Performance issues with large surveys | Medium | Medium | Implement lazy loading, optimize database queries |
| User confusion with survey creation | High | Medium | Create clear documentation, implement intuitive UI |
| Data loss during survey submissions | Low | High | Implement auto-save, robust error handling |

## Success Metrics
- 100% of surveys can be created, edited, and published through the admin interface
- Lead-to-survey flow works for 99.9% of eligible leads
- Survey responses are correctly associated with leads
- System maintains performance with concurrent survey submissions
- All analytics data is accurate and available in real-time
