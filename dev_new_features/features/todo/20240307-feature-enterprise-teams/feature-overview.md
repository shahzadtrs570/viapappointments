## Technical Architecture

### Database Models

The feature uses several key database models:

**Team Model**:
```prisma
model Team {
  id          String      @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  slug        String      @unique
  description String?
  logoUrl     String?
  ownerId     String
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime    @updatedAt

  // Relationships
  owner       User        @relation("TeamOwner", fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict)
  members     TeamMember[]
  // Other relationships...
}
```

**TeamMember Model**:
```prisma
model TeamMember {
  id        String    @id @default(cuid())
  teamId    String
  userId    String
  role      TeamRole  @default(MEMBER)
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt

  // Relationships
  team      Team      @relation(fields: [teamId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user      User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([teamId, userId])
}

enum TeamRole {
  OWNER
  ADMIN
  MEMBER
}
```

Additional models include TeamInvitation, TeamSettings, TeamResource, and TeamSubscription to support the full feature set.
