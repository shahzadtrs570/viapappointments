# Feature Overview: Enterprise Teams

## Feature Definition
I want to build an Enterprise Teams feature for organizations to collaborate within the NextJet platform by creating team structures with different permission levels, shared resources, and team-specific settings. This organizational management feature helps users work efficiently in teams by providing team creation, member management, role-based permissions, shared resources, and team billing.

## Target Audience
- Enterprise organizations with multiple users
- Teams within organizations needing to collaborate
- Business administrators managing user access
- Team leaders coordinating team resources

## Core Features
1. **Team Management**: Create/edit/delete teams with custom team slugs for URLs - High Priority
2. **Member Management**: Invite users to teams via email and assign roles (Owner, Admin, Member) - High Priority
3. **Permission System**: Role-based access control within teams with distinct permission levels - High Priority
4. **Team Resources**: Shared content libraries and team-specific settings - Medium Priority
5. **Team Billing**: Seat-based licensing model with team subscription plans - Medium Priority

## User Roles and Permissions
- **Owner**: Can manage all team settings, billing, and delete teams; can add/remove members and change roles
- **Admin**: Can manage team settings, add/remove members, but cannot delete team or manage billing
- **Member**: Standard access to team resources, cannot modify team settings or manage members

## App Flow
### Team Creation Flow
1. User enters via dashboard "Teams" section
2. User selects "Create Team" option
3. System displays team creation form (name, description, slug)
4. User submits form
5. System creates team and sets user as Owner
6. User is redirected to team dashboard

### Member Invitation Flow
1. Team Owner/Admin enters via team members section
2. User selects "Invite Member" option
3. System displays invitation form (email, role)
4. User submits form
5. System sends invitation email
6. Invited user clicks link and accepts invitation
7. System adds user to team with specified role

### Team Resource Management Flow
1. Team member enters via team dashboard
2. User navigates to shared resources section
3. System displays available resources
4. User can view, create, or modify resources based on their role permissions

## Technical Considerations
- Integration with existing user authentication system
- Database schema for team and member relationships
- API endpoints for team management operations
- Role-based middleware for permission checks
- Integration with billing system for team subscriptions

## Design Preferences
- Clean, professional interface consistent with existing dashboard design
- Clear visual indicators for team membership and roles
- Responsive design prioritizing desktop experience but ensuring mobile usability
- Intuitive navigation between personal and team resources

## Implementation Guidance
- Build on existing user authentication system
- Implement robust permission checks at API and UI levels
- Use existing design system components for consistent UX
- Ensure proper data isolation between teams
- Implement comprehensive testing for permission boundaries
