   - Page object model examples
   - Authentication handling and test fixtures

3. **Sample Test Implementation** (`sample-test-implementation.md`)
   - Concrete examples of test implementation
   - Authentication flow test examples
   - Page object implementations
   - Test data management

4. **Implementation Roadmap** (`implementation-roadmap.md`)
   - Phased approach to implementing Playwright tests
   - Task breakdown and timeline
   - Resource allocation and responsibilities
   - Risk assessment and success metrics

## Getting Started

To begin implementing Playwright testing in your project, follow these steps:

1. Read the **Playwright Testing Strategy** document to understand the overall approach
2. Follow the **Implementation Guide** to set up Playwright in your project
3. Use the **Sample Test Implementation** as a reference for creating your tests
4. Follow the **Implementation Roadmap** for a structured approach to test coverage

## Quick Setup

To quickly set up Playwright in your NextJet project:

```bash
# Install Playwright
pnpm add -D @playwright/test

# Install browser drivers
npx playwright install

# Create initial directory structure
mkdir -p tests/e2e/auth tests/e2e/dashboard tests/e2e/marketing tests/e2e/payment tests/e2e/fixtures tests/e2e/pages tests/e2e/utils
```

Add the following scripts to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
  "test:e2e:report": "playwright show-report"
}
```

## Configuration

Create a basic `playwright.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  testDir: './tests/e2e',
  timeout: 30000,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: [['html'], ['list']],
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
    { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
    { name: 'mobile chrome', use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] } },
    { name: 'mobile safari', use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] } },
  ],
};

export default config;
```

## Running Tests

Once you've implemented your tests, you can run them using the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run specific tests
pnpm test:e2e tests/e2e/auth

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
pnpm test:e2e:debug

# View test report
pnpm test:e2e:report
```

## Next Steps

After reviewing this documentation, we recommend:

1. Start with the authentication tests as demonstrated in the sample implementation
2. Progressively add tests for other critical features
3. Integrate Playwright testing into your CI/CD pipeline
4. Establish regular test maintenance practices
