      "title": "What is Viager?",
      "description": "Viager is a unique property sale arrangement with roots in French real estate tradition. You sell your home but retain the right to live in it for life (known as a \"life estate\"). This structure provides immediate capital while securing your housing needs for as long as you wish to remain in your home."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Financial Benefits",
      "description": "The viager arrangement provides significant financial benefits: an initial lump sum payment (typically 20-40% of property value) followed by guaranteed monthly payments for life. This creates reliable income without the need to move, downsize or manage rental properties, while eliminating property taxes and maintenance costs."
    },
    "difference": {
      "title": "The Srenova Difference",
      "description": "At Srenova, we modernise the traditional viager concept with transparent terms, fair valuations, and ongoing support. Our innovative approach combines the security of a traditional viager with modern financial protections and flexibility, all managed through our easy-to-use digital platform and dedicated advisers."
    },
    "peace": {
      "title": "Peace of Mind",
      "description": "Our viager arrangements are legally structured to protect your right to remain in your home for life. Unlike reverse mortgages or equity release schemes, there's no debt accumulation, no interest charges, and no risk of foreclosure. Your monthly payments are guaranteed regardless of market conditions."
