First, tell us if the property is owned by a single person, a couple, or multiple individuals. If there are multiple owners, please specify how many (up to 5). Then, for each owner, we'll need their full name and date of birth. Contact information like email and phone, as well as current address details, are optional but helpful. If you've already provided an address in a previous step (e.g., for the property itself), you might see an option to reuse that address for an owner to save you time.
