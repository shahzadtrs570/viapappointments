## Introduction  
Welcome to Srenova's Privacy Policy. Srenova ("we", "us", "our") is the trading name of Estate Flex Ltd (Company No. 14936575), headquartered at 2a Station Road, Marlow, SL7 1NB, United Kingdom. We operate an online platform that connects property sellers, estate agents, independent financial advisors (IFAs), and institutional investors in the UK and EU (with a focus on France). Protecting your personal data and privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect from you as a user of the Srenova platform, how we use and protect that information, and your rights in relation to your data. It is intended for platform users and prospective users, including sellers, investors, agents, and any visitors to our website or platform.

This Privacy Policy is written in plain English (British English) to be clear and understandable. We comply with all applicable data protection laws, including the UK GDPR, the EU GDPR, and relevant national laws like the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and France's data protection regulations. By using our platform or providing personal information to us, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please do not use the platform or provide your personal data.

**Controller Contact Details**: For the purposes of data protection law, the "controller" of your personal data is Estate Flex Ltd (trading as Srenova). You can reach us at:
- Address: 2a Station Road, Marlow, SL7 1NB, United Kingdom
- Email: [privacy@srenova.com](mailto:privacy@srenova.com) (for privacy inquiries and to exercise data rights)

If you are based in the EU, our main EU office is in France. You may alternatively contact our EU representative or simply use the contacts above which are accessible to EU users as well.

**Data Protection Officer**: We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee our privacy compliance. The DPO can be contacted at [dpo@srenova.com](mailto:dpo@srenova.com). You can contact our DPO directly for any issues regarding your personal data or if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.

## Personal Data We Collect

We only collect personal information that is necessary for the purposes stated in this policy. The types of personal data we collect fall into several categories:
- **Identity and Contact Data**: This includes information such as your full name, title, date of birth, nationality, postal address, email address, telephone number, and other contact details. For example, when you register an account on Srenova as an investor or seller, we will ask for your name, email, and phone. If you are acting as or on behalf of an organisation (like an institutional investor company or an estate agency), we may also collect your job title, the name of the organisation, and business contact details. As part of our due diligence, we might collect identification numbers (e.g. passport number, driver's licence number, or national ID card number) and copies of identification documents or proofs of address. These identity documents can contain personal details like your photograph (used for verification) and document identifiers; we handle these with high security due to their sensitive nature.
- **Financial Data**: For users involved in transactions, we may collect financial information. This can include bank account details or payment information (to facilitate payments or transfers related to property transactions or platform fees, if any), proof of funds or investment capacity (for investors, we might ask for bank statements or letters from financial institutions confirming available funds, or for institutional investors, we might collect company financial statements). We may also collect income or employment information and investment experience for compliance reasons (e.g. to ascertain investor qualification status or to ensure suitability of opportunities). For property sellers, we might collect information about any mortgage on the property or desired sale price which indirectly relates to financial standing. If any payments are processed on our platform, details of those transactions (amount, date, counterparties) will be recorded. Note: We do not store credit card numbers or similar payment instrument details directly; if we accept payments, that might be handled via a secure third-party payment processor in which case only a token or masked number is stored by us.
- **Residential and Property Data**: If you are a property seller or estate agent listing a property, we will collect information about the property and its ownership. This includes property address, type of property (e.g. residential, commercial), property details (size, features, condition), photos or videos of the property (which may sometimes incidentally contain personal data if, for example, family pictures or occupants are visible -- we advise blurring or removing personal images in such photos), and legal documents related to the property (title deed, proof of ownership, land registry excerpts). We will also record your ownership interest or authority to sell that property. For all users, we collect your current residential address as part of identity verification and for contact purposes; we may also record past addresses if needed for verification (such as part of an anti-money laundering check). If you are an investor, we might collect your preferences such as areas of interest (e.g. "looking for properties in London") or any current property holdings you disclose that might influence your investment strategy.
- **Professional and Background Data**: For certain user roles, we gather professional details. Estate agents may provide their agency name, license/registration number, years of experience, and any professional accreditation. IFAs using the platform might provide their firm name, regulatory authorization number (e.g. FCA number in the UK), and credentials. Institutional investors (which are often companies or funds) will provide company information including registration number, registered address, and names of directors or authorised persons acting on behalf. We might also collect information about ultimate beneficial owners if needed (for corporate investors) as required by AML laws. Additionally, we may keep a record of how you came to know about Srenova (e.g. if an IFA invited you, we link that relationship, or if you were referred by an existing user).
- **User Account Credentials**: When you create an account, we collect your username (which could be your email address) and password. Passwords are stored in hashed form and are not visible to us. We also assign you a user ID in our system. If you use two-factor authentication, we may store configuration details for that (e.g. your phone number for SMS 2FA or backup codes, all securely).
- **Communication Data**: Any communications you send to us or through our platform may be stored. This includes emails, messages sent via platform messaging features between users, chat conversations with our support, or phone call summaries if you speak with us (we will inform you if calls are recorded; generally we might just log the fact a call occurred and any follow-up needed rather than recording content). If you provide feedback, fill out a survey, or enter a promotion, those responses are also data we collect.
- **Usage Data**: We automatically collect some data about how you use our website/platform. This includes:
<ul className="ml-6">
  <li><strong>Technical Information</strong>: such as IP address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types, operating system and platform, and device type (desktop/mobile) and identifiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Log Information</strong>: details of your visits to the platform, such as the pages you viewed, the time and date of visit, the time spent on those pages, referral source (how you arrived at our site), and other usage statistics.</li>
  <li><strong>Actions on Platform</strong>: like clicks, features used (for instance, if you save a property to favourites, or send a message through the platform), and transaction-related actions (expressing interest in a listing, making an offer, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong>: we use cookies, pixels, and local storage to collect data about your interactions (see "Cookies and Tracking" below for details). These help us remember your preferences, log you in automatically, and analyse usage.</li>
</ul>
- **Special Categories**: Generally, we do not seek to collect any special category (sensitive) personal data about users (such as health, ethnicity, religious beliefs, biometric data for identification, etc.) through the platform. We ask that you do not provide this in any free-form field unnecessarily. The only potential sensitive data might be biometric in ID documents or criminal record information if, for example, we run a sanctions or background check (this would reveal if someone is on a fraud blacklist, which is indirectly criminal offence data). If any such processing is needed (for compliance checks), it will be handled in line with law and only as permitted.

### Children
Our services are not intended for individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you are under 18, please do not use the platform or provide any information. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a person under 18, we will delete it. (Note: Because our platform deals with financial and property transactions, users are expected to be adults or duly authorized representatives; this statement is to ensure minors do not inadvertently sign up.)

## How We Collect Personal Data

We collect your personal data in several ways:

- **Directly from You**: The majority of data is provided directly by you. You give us your identity, contact, and financial details when filling in registration forms, onboarding questionnaires, or profile information on our platform. For example, when creating an account, you type in your name, email, etc. When listing a property, you input the property details and upload documents/photos. If we ask you to complete a verification step, you provide the needed information (like uploading an ID scan or entering a code we send to your phone). You also directly communicate with us via messages, support queries, or phone, providing additional data. Any time you update your account (such as changing your address or adding a new payment method), that's data you actively give us.
- **From Your Transactions/Interactions**: Data is also collected as a by-product of your actions on the platform. For instance, as you engage in a property transaction, we generate records of offers made, agreements signed (if electronic), payments processed, etc. If you correspond with another party through our platform, that correspondence is captured on our system. When you use features or just browse listings, our system logs those events (this is partially automatic). So, simply using the platform yields usage data without you explicitly typing anything in every time.
- **From Third Parties**: Sometimes we obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as:
<ul className="ml-6">
  <li><strong>Introducers or Referrers</strong>: If an estate agent or IFA introduces you to Srenova, they might give us some of your details to set up an account or invitation (e.g. your name, email, and role as their client). We will ensure such third parties have your permission to share data with us.</li>
  <li><strong>Identity Verification and KYC providers</strong>: With your knowledge, we may use external services to verify your identity or run compliance checks. Those services might give us information such as verification confirmations, fraud risk scores, or information from databases (e.g. confirming whether an ID is legitimate, or retrieving corporate registry info about an institutional investor's directors for due diligence). For example, we might use a service that checks your ID against government databases or checks if you appear on sanctions lists, thus providing us results like "pass" or relevant data points (like "person is on XYZ list").</li>
  <li><strong>Credit Reference or Background Check Agencies</strong>: If applicable, and with appropriate legal basis, we might obtain credit reports or background check results for investors (for instance, to ensure an investor is financially sound or to flag any prior relevant criminal convictions like fraud). This is more likely for high-value transactions and in compliance with law -- we would inform you if we perform such checks. Any information from these agencies (credit score, credit history summaries, public records about bankruptcies or directorships, etc.) would become part of our records on you.</li>
  <li><strong>Publicly Available Sources</strong>: We could collect data from public records or websites for verification. For instance, we may check a company's listing at Companies House (UK) or the Registre du Commerce (France) to confirm details about an institutional investor company or an estate agency. We might also see publicly available news or professional information about key individuals (though we do not profile based on social media, etc., except if needed for fraud due diligence). Public land registry or cadastre data might be used to verify property ownership details provided by a seller.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies/Analytics Third Parties</strong>: As explained later, we use some third-party analytics tools (like Google Analytics) which collect usage data via cookies on our behalf when you use our site. Those third parties don't give us new personal info beyond what we described in usage data, but they help compile it (e.g. Google may provide aggregated demographics based on your IP or device if you've consented to such tracking).</li>
</ul>

We will only collect data from third parties if we have lawful grounds (for example, it is in our legitimate interest for fraud prevention, or it's necessary for contract -- such as verifying an investor's accreditation status -- or a legal obligation to do AML checks). In all cases, we aim to be transparent: this Privacy Policy serves to inform you that such third-party data collection might occur. If any third-party source significantly supplements your personal data, we will, where required by GDPR Article 14, inform you specifically of that source and any additional info obtained (unless an exemption applies, such as you already having that info or it was public).

We do not buy marketing lists or cold-call lists from brokers -- any marketing we do is to our own users or people who have expressed interest. If someone referred you to us and gave us your contact, we assume they had your consent to do so; if that's not the case, please let us know and we will rectify that.

## How We Use Your Personal Data (Purposes and Legal Basis)

Srenova uses your personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected, and in accordance with a lawful basis under data protection law. Below we describe the purposes of processing, with examples, and identify the legal bases we rely on for each. In many cases, more than one legal basis may apply.

### 1. To provide and maintain our services (perform our contract with you):
  - We use identity and contact data to register you as a new user, create your account, and manage the user relationship. This is necessary to perform our User Agreement (Terms & Conditions) with you. For example, your email and password let you log in, and we use your details to identify you in our system.
  - We use relevant personal data to facilitate transactions and interactions on the platform. For sellers and estate agents, this means using the property and personal data you provided to list your property and advertise it to investors on the platform. For investors, this means using your profile and search criteria to show you suitable listings and connect you with sellers/agents. When an investor expresses interest in a property, we use both parties' data to arrange viewings or meetings (e.g. sharing names and contact info with consent as the process moves forward). We generate transaction documents (like Heads of Terms, or digital contracts) using the data provided (names, addresses, property details). All these steps are part of the service you expect, and thus are based on contractual necessity.
  - We use data to communicate service-related messages. For example, we send confirmation emails when you register, notifications about inquiries or offers (if someone messages you or if there's an update on a property you listed), and important alerts (such as changes to our terms or privacy policy, or notices of platform downtime). Fulfilling these communications is necessary for the service (contract performance) and sometimes also a legal necessity (e.g. informing you of changes in contractual terms).
  - We maintain and improve the functionality of our platform. To do so, we might use usage data to ensure the website and app work correctly, debug issues, and personalize aspects of the service for you (like remembering your preferences or pre-filling forms with your info). While improvement can be a legitimate interest, basic functionality and personalisation are often part of the contract (for example, remembering your preferred language or properties you viewed is expected functionality). So this overlaps contract and legitimate interest.
  - If you are required to pay any fees or if there are any financial transactions facilitated through Srenova, we will use your financial data to process payments or payouts. For instance, if there's a platform commission or a deposit to be transferred, we use bank details to execute that. This is contractual (to provide the payment service you requested). We do this via secure third-party payment processors; we ensure such processing is also under contract.

**Legal Bases**: The primary legal basis here is "performance of a contract" (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)) -- we process your data to provide the services you signed up for, as described in our Terms. In some sub-cases, legal obligation (Art 6(1)(c)) might also apply (e.g. we must notify you of certain information or keep records as required by law). Where maintaining the service overlaps with improving it, we might also cite legitimate interests (Art 6(1)(f)) to run an effective platform, but not at the expense of your rights. We do not rely on consent for core service communications or processing that are intrinsic to the service.

### 2. Identity verification, security and compliance checks (legal obligation / legitimate interests):
- We use identity, contact, and document data to verify your identity when you register and periodically during use. This is crucial to prevent fraud, ensure users are who they claim (especially because significant financial transactions occur), and to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer regulations. For example, we may verify your email and phone via codes, and check your identity documents. In the UK and EU, laws against money laundering (e.g. UK Money Laundering Regulations, EU AML directives) often require us to verify customers engaging in financial transactions above certain thresholds. Thus, collecting and using this data is a legal obligation for us. Even where not strictly mandated by law for every user, it is in our legitimate interest to authenticate users to protect the security of the platform and trust among participants.
- We perform due diligence on investors and sellers. For investors, especially institutional or higher net worth individuals, we might confirm their status (like accredited or qualified investor status as required by financial regulations) -- this could involve processing financial data or confirmations from IFAs. For sellers, we verify ownership of properties (checking land registry info you provide), and that there are no legal impediments. We may also run screening against sanctions lists, anti-terrorism financing lists, or politically exposed persons (PEP) lists as part of AML compliance -- which is a legal obligation for certain transactions. If any red flags arise (like a person being on a sanctions list or a fraud database), we would use that data to decide whether to onboard or continue doing business, fulfilling our legal compliance and fraud prevention duties.
- We use account credentials and usage patterns for security monitoring. This includes using your login data and IP addresses to detect unusual login attempts (for example, if an account is accessed from a new location or multiple failed logins occur, we might log that and act on it). We also deploy measures like two-factor authentication and monitor how accounts behave to spot potential hacking or misuse. This processing is based on legitimate interests -- ensuring the security of our service and users' accounts -- and partly on legal obligation under GDPR Article 32 (to maintain security measures). For instance, if we detect that someone else might be impersonating you, we will use available data to intervene (lock the account, reach out to confirm activity, etc.).
- We keep logs and records of verifications and checks as part of our record-keeping obligations. AML laws require keeping identity verification records for at least 5 years. Data protection laws require we demonstrate consent where obtained, etc. So we process and store such data as a legal obligation.

**Legal Bases**: Legal obligation (Art 6(1)(c)) is key for any processing required by law (AML, fraud, regulatory compliance). For example, verifying identity to the extent required by law, reporting certain information to authorities, etc., falls under this. For other checks not explicitly required but done to protect our business and users (like additional fraud screening or general security measures), legitimate interests (Art 6(1)(f)) is the basis -- our interest in preventing fraud and securing our platform, which also benefits all users, and does not override individuals' rights given the safeguards and necessity of such processing. In some jurisdictions, explicit consent or substantial public interest bases might be relevant for processing any special category data in ID documents for fraud prevention, but generally we handle ID verification under AML legal obligations (which often constitutes a legal basis for limited biometric processing under national law).

### 3. Facilitating user interactions and deals (contractual and legitimate interests):
- Srenova acts as a facilitator connecting different parties. We will use your data to introduce or connect you with other users on the platform when both parties have indicated interest. For example, if you as an investor request details on a property, we might share some of your profile information with the estate agent or seller (like your name, maybe proof that you're a verified investor) and conversely share more property info with you. This is done to enable the next step in the transaction. We only share what is necessary -- often initial introductions might be done through the platform anonymously until you agree to share contact info. But once both sides are serious, exchanging contact data is part of performing the service (connecting buyers and sellers). The legal basis is contract (we're providing the service you signed up for) as well as legitimate interest (both you and the other party have a legitimate interest in knowing who each other are to proceed). We make sure this is expected by you (we won't share your details with another user without context; it happens as a natural progression of a deal, with your involvement).
- We may use communications data to mediate disputes or assist negotiations. For instance, if there's a misunderstanding between a buyer and seller, and they contact Srenova for help, we will use the messages or data we have to clarify or resolve the issue. This is part of our customer support (contractual duty to support users) and also our legitimate interest to maintain a good platform environment.
- For IFAs using the platform on behalf of clients: we might share certain client progress updates with the IFA (since they introduced the investor). For example, if an IFA's client is negotiating on a property, the IFA might be kept in the loop through their account (with the client's knowledge). This is facilitating the role the IFA plays, which is part of the service if the client came via that IFA. We ensure any data sharing respects confidentiality agreements.

**Legal Bases**: Primarily contract (Art 6(1)(b)) for enabling the core function of the platform -- connecting parties for potential contracts -- since users sign up expecting that. Additionally, legitimate interests (Art 6(1)(f)) of Srenova and users in having a smoothly functioning marketplace and successful transactions supports certain sharing and communications (as long as we balance it and don't overshare or violate expectations). We do not rely on consent for these necessary exchanges of data, because it's inherent in how the service works (though it could be argued that by using the service for a deal, you implicitly consent to the needed data sharing with the counterparty -- but contract covers it).

### 4. Customer support and user service (contractual and legitimate interests):

- If you contact us for help or questions, we will use your contact details and relevant account info to respond to your inquiries or support tickets. For example, if you email support about a problem logging in, we will use your email and account data to troubleshoot. This is part of our contract to provide assistance.
- We might follow up with you about incomplete registration or offers. For instance, if you started signing up but didn't finish verification, we may send a reminder email. Or if you showed interest in a property but haven't taken action, a gentle prompt offering help. We consider this part of user service (and our legitimate interest to engage users) but we carefully do not overstep into nuisance.
- We use conversation records to train our support staff (internally) and improve service. For example, we may internally analyse common questions or issues raised in communications to adjust our FAQs or training materials. When doing so, we focus on the issues rather than the individuals, or we anonymise data if using real examples for training. Legitimate interest in improving customer service quality is the basis here.
- If an issue requires escalation or involving other parties (like connecting with a tech team to solve a bug, or asking an estate agent about a listing issue a user reported), we will share the necessary info from your request to get it resolved. This again is contractual/legitimate interest to resolve your issue.

**Legal Bases**: Contract (if support is needed to fulfil the service) and legitimate interests (to maintain good customer relations and solve problems efficiently) apply. In some regulated cases, responding properly can also be seen as a legal necessity (e.g. consumer protection law obligations). But primarily, if you ask us to do something, we have your implied consent to use your data for that purpose, and under GDPR this falls under providing the service.

### 5. Marketing and promotional communications (consent or legitimate interests):

- **Direct Marketing to Our Users**: We may use your email, phone, or address to send you marketing communications about our services, new properties or investment opportunities, newsletters with market insights, or events Srenova hosts. If you are an existing user (for example, you registered as an investor or seller), in many jurisdictions we can send you marketing about similar services on the basis of legitimate interests (the "soft opt-in" concept), provided you haven't opted out. We ensure an easy opt-out mechanism in every message. Our legitimate interest is to grow our business and keep customers informed, and we balance this by only sending relevant, infrequent, and expected updates. However, where law requires (such as ePrivacy rules or if you're not yet a customer), we will only send marketing with your consent (for instance, if you signed up to a newsletter via our website without being a registered user, we would have asked you to opt in).
- **Third-Party Marketing**: We do not share your data with third parties for them to market to you without your consent. We might occasionally send you information about a partner's services if it's closely related (e.g. a trusted mortgage provider's offer) but that would come from us, and only if you haven't opted out of general marketing. We would not sell your contact info to external advertisers.
- **Targeted Platform Content**: Within our platform or website, we might tailor the content you see as a form of marketing. For instance, showing you featured properties or suggesting "You might be interested in these new listings" based on your activity. This is personalization using your usage data -- done under legitimate interests to provide a better experience and promote relevant offerings. It doesn't involve disclosing your data to others, just using it to customize your view.
- **Surveys and Feedback Requests**: We may use your contact info to request your feedback through surveys or reviews. This helps us improve our services and is considered within legitimate interests. You're not obligated to respond, of course.
- **Referral Programs**: If we have a referral program and you participate (say, you invite a friend to join Srenova by providing their email), we use your and the friend's data to facilitate that referral (sending the invite email, tracking if they sign up). We rely on you to have the friend's permission. We treat the friend's contact only for that invite; if they don't join, we won't keep using it except to avoid duplicate invites.

**Legal Bases**: For electronic direct marketing to new or prospective users, we will use consent (Art 6(1)(a)) -- e.g. ticking a box to receive newsletters. For current customers, we lean on legitimate interests (Art 6(1)(f)) combined with PECR's soft opt-in rule for similar products/services, ensuring opt-out ability. In any case, every marketing email will have an unsubscribe link to withdraw consent or object, fulfilling both GDPR and ePrivacy requirements. We also honor any Do Not Call/Contact preferences if you set them. Note that even if you opt out of marketing, we will still send essential service emails (per the contract).

### 6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and platform to provide, personalize, and improve your user experience. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your device that helps us remember your preferences and understand how you use our site. We use the following types of cookies:
- **Necessary Cookies**: These are essential for the operation of our platform. For example, they allow you to stay logged in as you navigate between pages, and remember items in your dashboard. Without these cookies, certain features would not function. We use these based on our legitimate interest in providing a working service and you cannot opt out of them as they are necessary for the website to function.
- **Preference/Functionality Cookies**: These remember your choices (such as language or region, or if you are an investor or seller) to provide a more tailored experience. For instance, if you choose to view properties in French, we might save that preference so you don't have to select it each time. While not strictly essential, they enhance functionality. We treat these similarly to necessary cookies when they are needed for the service, otherwise we ask consent where required.
- **Analytics Cookies**: We use these to collect information about how visitors use our platform, so we can improve it. For example, we use Google Analytics to see which pages are most popular, how users move through the site, and if they encounter errors. The data is aggregated and does not directly identify you. These cookies may track things like your IP address (anonymised), device type, and browsing patterns. We will only set analytics cookies with your consent. On your first visit, you will see a cookie banner requesting your permission to use these; if you agree, we place them, and if not, we won't. You can also adjust your cookie settings any time using our Cookie Preferences tool or your browser settings.
- **Advertising/Marketing Cookies**: Currently, Srenova does not display third-party ads, but we may in the future use cookies or pixels for our own marketing campaigns. For example, a Facebook Pixel or Google Ads cookie could be used so that, if you consent, we can show you Srenova ads on other platforms (often called retargeting, so you might see an ad on Facebook because you visited our site). These technologies would also only be used with your explicit consent.

**Cookie Choices**: On your first visit to our site, and periodically thereafter, we will prompt you to set your cookie preferences. You can choose to accept all cookies, reject non-essential ones, or customize your choices. Even after your initial choice, you can change your mind at any time by accessing the "Cookie Settings" link on our site or through your browser's settings (where you can typically clear or block cookies). Please note that if you disable certain cookies, parts of the platform might become less functional or unavailable (for instance, blocking all cookies might prevent login). For more details on cookies we use, you can see our separate Cookie Policy or the list in the Cookie Settings panel.

We also may use other tracking technologies like web beacons (tiny graphic images) in our emails to know if you opened them, which helps us gauge the effectiveness of our communications. You can disable images in your email if you do not wish to be tracked in that way.

By default, we do not share data collected by cookies with third parties except our analytics and service partners (like Google) who process it for our purposes. We do not allow third-party advertisers to collect your data for their own uses without your consent.

## Disclosure of Your Personal Data (Who We Share It With)

Srenova will never sell your personal data to third parties for their own marketing use. However, in order to provide our services and comply with our obligations, we do need to share personal information with certain parties. We ensure that such sharing is done securely and only to the extent necessary. The key categories of recipients are: 
- **Other Users on the Platform**: Since our service connects different parties, we will share some of your information with other registered users when appropriate. For example, if you are a property seller or estate agent, we will display property information you provide (e.g. property details, photos, general location) publicly on the platform to all potential investors. Your personal contact details (name, email, phone) are not displayed publicly to casual browsers. However, when an interested investor proceeds to a certain stage (such as requesting a viewing or making an offer), we may share contact details between you and that investor so you can communicate directly.Likewise, if you are an investor, your profile is not public to everyone, but when you express serious interest in a property, the seller/agent will learn your identity and contact information (and possibly proof of funds status) so they can engage with you. We facilitate this exchange as part of the platform's services. We only share what is necessary -- typically name, company (if applicable), and contact info at the appropriate time, and any documents you choose to share (e.g. if you send a proposal or ID copy to the other party through our platform). All users are bound by our Terms to use such information only for transaction-related purposes.
- **Service Providers (Processors)**: We employ trusted third-party companies to perform certain tasks on our behalf, who process personal data under our instructions. These include:
<ul className="ml-6">
  <li><strong>IT Infrastructure and Cloud Services</strong>: (e.g. web hosting companies, cloud storage providers) that store our application and database. Your data is kept on their secure servers but they cannot use it except to maintain storage and backup.</li>
  <li><strong>Identity Verification and Compliance Partners</strong>: firms that help us with KYC/AML checks, such as services that verify identity documents or screen names against sanction lists. They receive identity details and documents, perform the check, and return results to us. They act as our data processors, and any data they handle is for our compliance purposes only.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment and Banking Partners</strong>: if payments (like deposit escrows, or fee processing) go through third-party payment gateways or banking institutions, they will receive necessary personal data (like your name, account number, and payment amount) to process those transactions. For example, if we use Stripe or a similar payment processor for online payments, they handle your card or bank information on our behalf. Such providers are contractually obligated to secure your data and only use it for the transaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Email and Communications Tools</strong>: we use email service providers (for sending out bulk emails like verification emails, newsletters) and possibly SMS gateways for verification codes. They will process your contact details and message content as needed to deliver communications.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics and Performance Tools</strong>: third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics) which use cookies as described above. They act on our behalf to analyse usage data. These partners might collect your IP and device info (if you consent to analytics cookies), but this data is generally aggregated and not used to personally identify you by these providers.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Consultants</strong>: We may engage IT consultants, developers, or customer support outsourcing who in the course of their work may have limited access to personal data. For instance, an IT developer troubleshooting an issue might see user data in our database. These parties are all under strict contracts and confidentiality agreements with Srenova to protect any data they encounter.</li>
</ul>

All our service providers are bound by Data Processing Agreements to protect your information. We only use processors that provide sufficient guarantees to meet GDPR standards and to protect data subjects' rights. They cannot use your data for anything outside of what we instruct. We remain responsible for their actions regarding your personal data.

- **Professional Advisors**: We may share personal data with our auditors, lawyers, insurers, or other professional advisors to Srenova. This would happen only on a need-to-know basis for specific purposes, such as obtaining legal advice (e.g. reviewing a contract that includes your information), conducting an audit (e.g. an auditor examining our records might see some customer transactions), or handling an insurance claim. These parties are typically independent data controllers (e.g. law firms) but are bound by professional confidentiality and data protection law.
- **Business Partners**: If we partner with other organizations for joint events or promotions directly related to our service, we might share contact information with them, but only with your knowledge or consent. For example, if you sign up for a co-hosted seminar with a real estate association via Srenova, and consent to share details with them, we will do so. Otherwise, we do not grant partners your data.
- **Other Users' Advisors**: In a transaction, sometimes an investor's solicitor or a seller's notary might request certain information (like proof of identity of the other party or copies of agreements). We will facilitate sharing that data either through the parties themselves or directly if needed, since it's part of completing the deal (and you would be aware as part of the transaction process).
- **Regulators and Law Enforcement**: We may disclose personal data to government authorities, law enforcement, regulators, or courts if required to do so by law or under a valid legal request. For instance, we might need to provide information to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) or CNIL if they are investigating a data protection complaint, or to financial regulators if there's an audit or inquiry. Likewise, if a law enforcement agency presents a lawful subpoena or warrant for user information (for example, for an investigation into fraud or money laundering), we are obligated to comply. Whenever permitted, we will inform affected users about such requests (unless legally barred from doing so).
- **Corporate Transactions**: If Srenova (Estate Flex Ltd) undergoes a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, sale of assets, or investment due diligence, personal data may be shared or transferred as part of that process. We would ensure that any receiving party commits to respect this Privacy Policy or provides equivalent protection. In the event of a full acquisition, your data would likely become subject to the privacy policy of the new owner, but we will notify you in advance and give you an opportunity to exercise your rights (for example, to delete your data if you wish) before any transfer.

In all cases of sharing, we adhere to the principle of minimisation: only the information necessary for the purpose will be shared. We also take steps (contractual and technical) to ensure that the receiving party handles the information securely and lawfully. If any third party is outside the UK/EU, we will also implement international transfer safeguards as described in the next section.

## International Data Transfers

We are a UK-based company but also operate within the EU (France), and we serve users across these regions. Generally, the personal data we collect is stored on servers located in the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA). However, some of our service providers or group companies may be located outside of the UK and EEA, and we also may need to transfer data across borders for global accessibility. Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of the UK or EU, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing appropriate safeguards.
- **UK--EEA Transfers**: Transfers between the UK and EU happen in our day-to-day operations (for example, if we have a database in the UK accessed by our team in France, or vice versa). The European Commission has determined that the UK's data protection regime is adequate, meaning personal data can flow from the EU to the UK freely (under the EU GDPR adequacy decision of 28 June 2021). Similarly, the UK recognises EEA countries as adequate. Therefore, we can transfer data between the UK and EU without additional measures. We still treat all such data with the same care and according to both UK and EU GDPR standards. We monitor the status of this adequacy; if it were to lapse or change, we would implement alternative safeguards described below to continue lawful transfers.
- **Transfers Outside UK/EU**: If we or our sub processors need to transfer your data to countries which are not deemed "adequate" by the UK government or European Commission (meaning those countries may not have laws considered equivalent to European data protection law), we will ensure one of the following safeguards is in place:
<ul className="ml-6">
  <li><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong>: We commonly rely on EU-approved standard data protection clauses in contracts with the recipient of the data. These clauses impose strict data protection obligations on the recipient and ensure your data continues to benefit from a high level of protection even after transfer. For example, if we use a US-based cloud provider, we sign SCCs requiring them to protect your data and granting you rights, which you can enforce if necessary. The UK has its own equivalent (the International Data Transfer Addendum or UK SCCs) which we also use for UK to non-UK transfers.</li>
  <li><strong>Adequacy Decisions</strong>: If the country has been approved by the EU or UK as offering adequate protection (e.g. countries like Canada, Switzerland, Japan have EU adequacy decisions), we will rely on that and transfer under that basis.</li>
  <li><strong>Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)</strong>: If we were part of a corporate group with intra-group transfers outside the EEA, and that group has approved BCRs, we could use those. (At present, this is not applicable to Srenova, as we are small, but we mention it for completeness.)</li>
  <li><strong>Derogations (Limited Circumstances)</strong>: In the rare absence of the above, we may rely on specific GDPR derogations for transfers. For instance, if you as a user are located outside the UK/EU and you initiate a transaction requiring your data to go to that country, that is considered your explicit consent or necessary for performance of a contract with you. Another example is if a transfer is necessary for the establishment or defence of legal claims. These cases are exceptional and we try to avoid them by using the structured safeguards above.</li>
</ul>

Before any significant transfer, we assess the destination country's data protection environment and, if needed, put in place additional technical measures. For example, we might encrypt data before sending it overseas and keep the decryption keys in the UK/EU, or employ other measures recommended by authorities, especially in light of the Schrems II ruling for EU-US data flows. Our goal is that wherever your data travels, it remains as secure and protected as within the UK/EU.

You can request more information about our international transfer safeguards by contacting us (see Contact section below). If needed, we can provide a copy of the relevant SCCs or details on any other mechanism (some parts may be redacted for commercial confidentiality or security). Rest assured, any third-party processor outside of UK/EU handling your data is contractually bound to us to uphold GDPR-level standards, and we closely monitor compliance with those terms.

## Data Retention -- How Long We Keep Your Data

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. This means different types of data may be kept for different lengths of time, based on context:

- **Account Information**: If you have an active account with Srenova, we retain your personal data for as long as your account is in use. You can update or correct most information at any time through your profile. If you choose to close your account or it remains inactive for an extended period, we will initiate deletion of your personal data. However, we may keep certain information in archived form for a certain retention period (typically up to 5-7 years) after account closure. This retention allows us to comply with legal obligations (for example, anti-money laundering laws may require us to keep identity verification and transaction records for 5 years; tax laws may require keeping financial records for 6 years) and to have an audit trail in case of disputes or complaints (the usual statute of limitations for contract claims is 6 years in the UK). During this post-closure retention, your data will be stored securely and not actively processed except for archiving purposes -- and we will of course honour any applicable rights requests (like if you request erasure of residual data that we do not need to keep by law).
- **Transaction Records**: If you engage in a property transaction or investment through the platform, details of that transaction (contracts, payments, communications) may be retained as part of our business records. We generally retain transaction data for a minimum of 6 years from completion, given legal requirements and potential dispute windows. For instance, property sale agreements and related correspondence might be kept that long for legal archiving. If a transaction involves financial information, we may have to retain it per finance regulations as mentioned.
- **Marketing Data**: If you have consented to receive marketing, we keep your contact details on our marketing list until you unsubscribe or inform us you no longer wish to receive such communications. If you opt-out or withdraw consent, we will move your contact info to a suppression list to ensure we respect your choice going forward. We may still keep a record that you had given consent in the past and then withdrew it, for compliance evidence, but we won't send you further marketing. If you never confirmed a marketing opt-in (e.g. you didn't respond to a verification email), we might purge your contact after a short time.
- **Usage Logs**: Web server logs, audit trails, and analytic data are kept for a shorter period unless needed for security analysis. Typically, raw web logs might be retained for a few months up to a year. Analytical data in tools like Google Analytics can be kept for 14 months (as per our settings) or more in aggregate form, but it's not personally identifiable after that initial retention and we use it only for trend analysis.
- **Communications**: If you contact support or have email/chat exchanges via the platform, those communications are generally kept as long as your account is active and for a period after (as they form part of the record of our interactions with you). If you delete your account, we might retain support tickets for a few years in case of later reference, but will purge them when no longer needed. Voice call recordings (if any) would be kept only if necessary (we currently do not record most calls, but if we did for quality training, we would notify you and typically not keep them beyond a short evaluation period).
- **Documents You Upload**: Documents like ID scans or property documents may be deleted or redacted once they've served their immediate purpose. For example, if you uploaded an ID for verification, we store the result of verification and may store a copy of the ID for compliance record for the required retention (5 years for AML in many cases). Property photos and listing info may remain on our platform as part of historical listings, but if you withdraw a listing or delete your account, we will generally remove or anonymize those on request.

After the applicable retention period ends, or if data is no longer needed, we will either delete it in a secure manner or anonymize it. Deletion involves removing data from our live systems, and we make sure any partners/processors do the same. Data may persist in backups for a short duration until those backups cycle out (our backup systems are typically on rotation; we ensure backups aren't kept longer than necessary). If restoring a backup that contains data already deleted in live systems, we will re-delete that data promptly. Anonymization means we strip personal identifiers so the remaining data can no longer be associated with you -- we might do this for data that we want to keep for statistical purposes (e.g. overall transaction volumes) without retaining personal info.

Please note that in some cases, even if you request deletion, we might retain certain information if required by law or if there are compelling legitimate grounds. For instance, if you were involved in a transaction, we cannot erase that transaction's records from our files before the retention period ends, due to legal obligations. In such a scenario, we would inform you of the retention and isolate the data from active use.

We aim not to keep personal data in identifiable form longer than necessary. If you have questions about specific retention periods for certain data categories, feel free to contact us. Our internal Data Retention Policy outlines these timelines in more detail, and we adhere to those schedules to avoid indefinite retention.

## Data Security

Srenova has implemented strong security measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, alteration, or disclosure. We understand the sensitivity of the financial, identity, and residential data we handle, and we treat security as a top priority. Key aspects of our data security program include:

- **Technical Security Measures**: All data you provide to us is stored on secure servers. We use encryption technologies to protect data in transit and at rest. For example, our website and platform enforce HTTPS for all communications, meaning information you input is encrypted while it travels from your browser to our servers. Sensitive data (like passwords) is stored hashed or encrypted. We employ firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control lists to prevent unauthorized network access. Regular security patches are applied to our software and infrastructure. We also run periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests (often via third-party specialists) to identify and fix potential weaknesses.
- **Organisational Measures**: Access to personal data within Srenova is restricted on a need-to-know basis. Only personnel who require access to your information to perform their job (e.g. our support team, compliance officer, relevant developers) are granted access, and even then only to the data necessary for their task. We have internal policies in place covering data confidentiality, and all staff are trained on these. Each employee is bound by a confidentiality agreement as part of their employment. We maintain logs of access to sensitive systems -- so any access to your data by staff is recorded and auditable.
- **Account Security for Users**: We urge you to keep your login credentials confidential. We implement measures like session timeouts and have options for two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to your account (for instance, you can opt to receive a one-time code on your phone when logging in). If we detect unusual activity on your account (such as logins from a new device or multiple failed login attempts), we may alert you and/or temporarily lock the account as a precaution. You are responsible for using a strong, unique password and protecting it -- we'll never ask you for your password via email or phone.
- **Payment Security**: If you make or receive payments through our platform, we use PCI-DSS-compliant payment processors. We do not store sensitive card details on our systems; those are handled by the payment gateway. Bank data used for transfers is handled with encryption.
- **Physical and Environmental Security**: Our offices (and any data centres we use) have appropriate physical security controls. This includes locked doors, controlled access for staff, CCTV in secure areas, and secure disposal procedures for any paper records (shredding) or old hardware (secure wiping or destruction of drives).
- **Monitoring and Breach Procedures**: We actively monitor our systems for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. Despite all efforts, no system can be 100% secure. That's why we have an incident response plan. In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal data, we will act promptly to contain and investigate it. We will also inform you and the relevant authorities as required by law. If a breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights (e.g. a serious hack where your financial data is exposed), we will notify you without undue delay, providing you with information on what happened and any steps you should take to protect yourself, in line with our obligations. Our goal is to be transparent and helpful in such situations, and to take all necessary actions to prevent any further damage.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You can assist by also taking precautions: use antivirus software, do not share your account details, and notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account or personal data. We will support you in securing your account. Remember that Srenova personnel will never ask you for your password, and you should be cautious of any phishing attempts pretending to be us. Always verify that emails from Srenova come from our official domain and when in doubt, contact us directly through our website or known contact channels.

## Your Rights as a Data Subject

Under applicable data protection laws (UK and/or EU GDPR), you have a number of important rights regarding the personal data we hold about you. We respect and uphold these rights, and this section explains what they are and how you can exercise them. You may exercise these rights free of charge (except in rare cases of excessive or unfounded requests, where a reasonable fee may be charged). The main rights are:

- **Right of Access**: You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, and to obtain information about how we process it. This is commonly known as a "Subject Access Request." On request, we will provide you with a copy of your data in a structured format, along with details on the purposes of processing, the categories of data, any recipients, the retention period, and the safeguards regarding any international transfers. (Most of this information is in this Privacy Policy, but you can also get it specific to you and confirm what data we have about you.)
- **Right to Rectification**: If any of your personal data that we hold is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to have it corrected. You can correct much of your basic information by logging into your account (for example, you can update your contact details). For any other corrections, you can contact us and we will promptly make the amendments and confirm to you once done. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide (for instance, if you change your name, we might ask for proof if it's critical).
- **Right to Erasure**: This is also known as the "right to be forgotten." You may ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it. For example, if you cancel your account and you want all personal data deleted, you can request this. We will erase the data unless certain exemptions apply. Common exemptions: we may retain data if required for legal obligations or if processing is necessary for the establishment or defence of legal claims. Also, if you have an ongoing transaction or contract through Srenova, we'd need to retain records of that. We will inform you if any data cannot be fully erased and the reasons. We'll certainly delete any data that is not necessary to keep.
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances -- for instance, if you contest the accuracy of the data (until it's verified), or if you object to processing (while we assess our overriding grounds), or if processing is unlawful but you don't want full erasure. While processing is restricted, we will store the data but not use it. We will inform you before lifting any such restriction.
- **Right to Object**: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data when we rely on legitimate interests (or public interest) as our legal basis, and you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have an absolute right to object to your data being used for direct marketing purposes.
  <ul className="ml-6">
   <li><strong>Objecting to Legitimate Interests</strong>: We have explained the contexts where we rely on legitimate interests (e.g. some communications, analytics, security). If you object, please explain your specific situation so we can review. We will then stop processing the data in that way unless we have compelling legitimate grounds that override your rights (or if it's needed for legal claims). We will respond to let you know our decision.</li>
   <li><strong>Objecting to Marketing</strong>: If you object to marketing, we will promptly stop using your data for that purpose. This is easily done by clicking "unsubscribe" in any marketing email or adjusting your communication preferences in your account settings. You can also email us to opt out. Once you opt out, you won't receive further promotional messages, though we may still send essential service communications.</li>
  </ul>
- **Right to Data Portability**: You have the right, in certain scenarios, to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, and have the right to transmit that data to another controller. This right applies to data that you have provided to us, and that we process by automated means based on your consent or on a contract with you. For example, if you wanted to switch to a different platform and wanted a copy of all the data you gave us (profile info, etc.), we can provide that in a CSV or JSON file. If technically feasible, you can also request that we send this file directly to another company, if you want them to have your data. We will comply as long as it does not adversely affect the rights of others (e.g. we won't include someone else's personal data in the file without their consent).
- **Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-Making**: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless it is necessary for entering or performing a contract, is authorised by law, or you have given explicit consent. In plain terms, this means if we ever were to use algorithms to make significant decisions about you (like fully automated credit approval/denial, etc.), we owe you certain safeguards, like the right to have a human review and appeal the decision. Currently, Srenova does not make any such automated decisions that have legal or significant effects. Most of our processing involves human involvement (for instance, even matching investors with properties is guided by your input and choices, not a black-box algorithm deciding your opportunities). If that changes (say we introduce a credit scoring feature), we will inform you and ensure compliance with Article 22 GDPR.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent**: In situations where we rely on your consent to process your data (e.g. for sending marketing emails, or setting analytics cookies), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we did based on your consent before withdrawal. If you withdraw consent for marketing, we explained above we will remove you from our lists. If you withdraw consent for cookies, you can do so via the cookie settings and we will stop those tracking processes. For any other consent-based processing, let us know and we will cease that activity.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided in this policy. We may need to request specific information from you to confirm your identity (as a security measure) before fulfilling your request. This is to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to anyone who does not have the right to receive it. For example, if an email doesn't match our records, we might ask you to verify some other info or provide ID. We try to make this verification as convenient as possible.

We will respond to all legitimate requests without undue delay and within one month at the latest. If your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests, we may extend this period by a further two months, but we will let you know and explain why. If we refuse a request (rare, and only if an exemption applies), we will explain our reasoning and inform you of your ability to complain to a supervisory authority.

**Your right to lodge a complaint**: If you have any concerns or are not satisfied with how we've handled your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Supervisory Authority. You can do this in the UK or in the EU country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach may have occurred. In the UK, our lead authority is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). In France, it is the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL). We provide contact details for these authorities below. We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach a regulator, so please consider reaching out to us first. We take privacy complaints very seriously and will seek to resolve the matter in a fair and transparent manner.

Contacting supervisory authorities:
- **ICO (UK)**: Website: ico.org.uk | Tel: +44 303 123 1113 | Address: ICO, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF, UK.
- **CNIL (France)**: Website: cnil.fr | Tel: +33 1 53 73 22 22 | Address: CNIL, 3 Place de Fontenoy, TSA 80715, 75334 Paris, Cedex 07, France.

Or you can contact your local EU Data Protection Authority; a list is available on the European Data Protection Board's website. We will cooperate fully with whichever authority is handling your complaint.

## Contact Us for Privacy Inquiries

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, about how we handle your data, or if you wish to exercise your rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) or privacy team:
- Email: [privacy@srenova.com](mailto:privacy@srenova.com) (or [dpo@srenova.com](mailto:dpo@srenova.com))
- Postal Mail: Data Protection Officer -- Srenova (Estate Flex Ltd), 2a Station Road, Marlow, SL7 1NB, United Kingdom.

We will endeavour to respond promptly to any request or question. Communication in English is preferred for fastest response, but we can also handle inquiries in French if needed (it just might take a bit longer for translation).

If you're unsure about anything in this Privacy Policy or how Srenova uses your data, please reach out. We believe in transparency and will gladly provide additional information or clarification. Your trust is important to us, and we want you to feel confident that your personal information is safe and handled properly.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by appropriate means -- for example, by email to the address associated with your account, or by a prominent notice on our website or within the platform. We will also update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.

If we update the policy, we may seek your consent again for certain processing if required (for instance, if a change relates to a new purpose that requires consent). By continuing to use the platform after those changes become effective, you are deemed to accept the revised Policy, but rest assured that we would not materially reduce your rights without obtaining your consent.

This Privacy Policy is available to you at any time. You can find it on our website (usually in the footer link) and in the app. If you require a copy in a different format, please let us know.

Thank you for taking the time to read this Privacy Policy. We hope it has clarified how we handle your personal data and your associated rights. Your privacy is at the heart of our design and operations, and we will continue to safeguard it as part of our commitment to excellent service. If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact us.
