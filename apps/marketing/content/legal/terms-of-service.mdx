Last Updated: 7th May, 2025

Welcome to Srenova! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Srenova online platform and services (the "Platform"). Srenova is operated by Estate Flex Ltd (company number 14936575), with registered address at 2a Station Road, Marlow, SL7 1NB, UK. In these Terms, "Srenova", "we", or "us" refers to Estate Flex Ltd; "you" or "User" refers to any person or entity using our Platform. By creating an account or otherwise using the Srenova Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy and any other policies referenced herein. If you do not agree, you must not use the Platform. We recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms for your records.

## 1. Definitions

In these Terms, certain capitalised terms have specific meanings:
- **Platform**: The Srenova online platform, including our website and any applications, through which property investment opportunities (such as viager transactions, property sales, etc.) are listed and through which Users can interact.
- **Institutional Investor**: A User that is a legal entity or institutional client (such as a pension fund, investment fund, bank, company, or other organisation) using the Platform to find and invest in property opportunities. This may also include accredited/high-net-worth investors using the Platform in a similar capacity.
- **Property Seller**: A User who is an owner (or authorised representative of an owner) of real estate property and who lists or seeks to list that property for sale (or investment arrangement) on the Platform.
- **Estate Agent**: A User who is a professional estate agent, broker, or agency representing property sellers on the Platform. Estate Agents may post listings, manage inquiries, and facilitate transactions on behalf of sellers.
- **IFA**: Stands for Independent Financial Advisor. A User who is a financial advisor or intermediary introducing investors to the Platform or assisting investor clients in evaluating opportunities on Srenova. An IFA might manage or co-manage an Institutional Investor's account or simply act as an advisor outside the Platform while the investor uses the Platform.
- **User**: Any registered user of the Platform, including Institutional Investors, Property Sellers, Estate Agents, IFAs, or other participants (such as prospective investors who are individuals).
- **Content**: Any text, images, data, or other material posted or transmitted on the Platform. This includes property listings, descriptions, photos, documents, user profiles, messages, and feedback.
- **Agreement**: Refers collectively to these Terms and Conditions, our Privacy Policy, and any other guidelines, rules, or documents expressly incorporated by reference. This Agreement forms a binding legal contract between you and Srenova governing your use of the Platform.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Platform, or by clicking "I agree" or similar when this option is made available, you confirm that you accept these Terms. If you are using the Platform on behalf of an organisation (for example, you are an employee of an institutional investor or an estate agent company), you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that organisation to these Terms. In that case, "you" shall also refer to the organisation you represent.

You must be 18 years or older to use the Srenova Platform. By registering, you affirm that you are at least 18 and capable of entering into a legally binding agreement. The Platform is intended for use by professionals and adults involved in real estate and investment; it is not for use by minors.

If you do not agree with these Terms at any point, you must stop using the Platform. Continued use will be deemed acceptance of any updated Terms. We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms from time to time (see Section 14 on changes).

## 3. User Registration and Account Security

To access most features of the Platform, you will need to create a Srenova account. When registering:
- **Provide Accurate Information**: You agree to provide true, current, and complete information about yourself (or your organisation) as prompted by the sign-up process. This includes your real name or business name, contact details, and any verification information requested. If any of your information changes (e.g. you change address or your organisation details update), you must promptly update your account to reflect those changes. We may suspend or terminate your account if we suspect the information is false, outdated, or misleading.
- **Account Types**: You will be asked to designate your account as an Institutional Investor, Property Seller, Estate Agent, or IFA (or other category as applicable). Ensure you register under the correct category that reflects your role, as different features and obligations may apply to each. For example, estate agents might have the ability to post listings, while investors do not.
- **One Account; No Transfer**: Each User (individual or entity) may maintain only one principal account of each type. Do not create multiple accounts to bypass restrictions or gain additional benefits without permission from Srenova. Your account is personal to you or your organisation and you must not transfer or sell it to any other party without our consent.
- **Credentials Security**: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials (username and password). Do not share your password with anyone. If you suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation, you must notify Srenova immediately at [security@srenova.com](mailto:security@srenova.com). We encourage the use of strong passwords and enabling of two-factor authentication if available. Srenova will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorised access resulting from your failure to secure your account.
- **Email and Contact Consent**: By registering, you consent to receive communications from Srenova electronically (via the Platform, email, or phone as provided). These communications can be about your account, transactions, legal notices, or promotional content as per your preferences. You can manage promotional communication preferences via your account settings or opt-out links (see Privacy Policy for more details). However, certain service or legal notices will still be sent as they are part of this Agreement.
- **Verification**: As part of account creation or thereafter, Srenova may require identity verification or additional documentation (especially for Institutional Investors, Estate Agents, and IFAs). You agree to provide such information or documents (for example, company registration proof, proof of regulatory status, ID for individuals, authorization letters, etc.) and acknowledge that account activation or continued access may be conditional on satisfactory verification. We reserve the right to refuse registration or to suspend accounts if verification is not completed or if concerns arise.

## 4. Platform Usage and User Obligations

Srenova provides a platform facilitating introductions and interactions among Institutional Investors, Property Sellers, Estate Agents, and IFAs. While we aim to ensure a smooth marketplace, certain responsibilities lie with you as a user to use the Platform lawfully and properly:
- **Compliance with Laws**: You agree to use the Platform in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes (but is not limited to) data protection laws (you must treat other users' personal data obtained through the Platform in accordance with privacy laws), anti-money laundering regulations, anti-fraud and anti-corruption laws, financial services regulations (if applicable to you), and property sale laws. For example, Estate Agents and Sellers must comply with any consumer protection or property disclosure laws in their jurisdiction when posting listings. IFAs must adhere to financial advisory regulations and only operate within their authorisations. Institutional Investors must ensure they meet any legal criteria for investments they pursue.
- **Acceptable Use**: You shall not misuse the Platform. Specifically, you agree not to:
<ul className="ml-6">
  <li>Post or transmit any unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful content. This includes content that is defamatory, obscene, harassing, threatening, or that promotes discrimination or violence.</li>
  <li>Use the Platform for any purpose that is unauthorised or outside the scope of what it is intended for. For instance, do not use it to advertise services unrelated to property investments, and do not scrape data or use it as a generic data source.</li>
  <li>Infringe intellectual property or other rights. Do not upload content (such as property images or descriptions) that you do not have the right to use. Ensure you have permission or rights for all content you upload (see IP section below).</li>
  <li>Interfere with the Platform's operation or security. This means no hacking, viruses, malicious code, denial of service attacks, or attempting to circumvent security features. Also, do not attempt to gain unauthorised access to other accounts or our systems.</li>
  <li>Harvest or misuse data. You must not harvest information about other users for any outside purpose, especially personal data, without consent. Any data you obtain through transactions (e.g. contact info of a counterparty) must be used solely for that transaction and not added to your own marketing lists without permission.</li>
  <li>Engage in any activity that would damage Srenova's reputation or integrity of the marketplace. This includes not engaging in deceptive practices on the Platform (like bidding on a property with no intention to proceed, or artificially inflating interest), and no spamming or scamming other users.</li>
</ul>
- **Institutional Investor Obligations**: If you are an Institutional Investor, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have the authority and any necessary regulatory clearance to make the types of investments you pursue on Srenova; (b) any funds used for investments are from lawful sources; (c) you will conduct your own independent due diligence on opportunities (Srenova is not providing investment advice or guarantees); (d) you will treat sellers and agents professionally and honour commitments you make (for example, if you enter into a purchase agreement, you intend to follow through barring due diligence issues or other contractual contingencies). You are responsible for obtaining your own legal, financial, and tax advice on transactions.
- **Property Seller Obligations**: If you are a Property Seller, whether individual or representing an organisation, you agree to: (a) provide accurate and complete information about your property and your right to sell it. You must not list a property unless you are the owner or have the clear authority/mandate to sell it; (b) update your listing if any information changes or if the property is no longer available; (c) not list multiple times for the same property or post fake listings; (d) handle inquiries and negotiations in good faith. You must also comply with any local laws requiring certain information or documents to be provided to prospective buyers (for example, in France, providing diagnostics or details on charges). You are solely responsible for the content of your property listings.
- **Estate Agent Obligations**: If you are an Estate Agent using Srenova: (a) you confirm that you are a licensed/registered estate agent (or equivalent) in the jurisdiction(s) where you operate, if such licensure is required by law, and will provide proof to Srenova upon request; (b) you have obtained the necessary consent and authority from the property owner to list the property on Srenova and to handle ensuing communications. You should upload or share only those property details approved by the owner; (c) you will act in accordance with professional standards and any code of conduct applicable to estate agents. This includes accurately conveying offers to your client, not misrepresenting any facts, and treating all parties fairly; (d) you remain responsible for compliance with estate agency laws, e.g., providing required disclosures to buyers, handling anti-money laundering checks for transactions as required of agents, etc. Srenova provides the platform but does not assume your regulatory responsibilities; (e) any leads or data you obtain through Srenova about investors are to be used solely for the purpose of the relevant property transaction, unless the investor separately engages with you outside the Platform by mutual agreement.
- **IFA Obligations**: If you are an Independent Financial Advisor: (a) You must ensure you have any necessary regulatory authorisation (for example, FCA authorisation in the UK) to provide investment advice to clients if you are doing so in relation to opportunities on Srenova. You should only use the Platform within the scope of what you are legally permitted to do; (b) If you introduce a client to Srenova or assist a client on Srenova, you should disclose to them any arrangement you have with Srenova (for instance, if there are referral fees or platform access provisions). [Note: At present, Srenova may or may not have a formal IFA referral program; if it does, any terms of that program will apply in addition]; (c) You will keep confidential any information you learn about opportunities on Srenova, only sharing with your client as necessary. Any documentation or data provided through the Platform should be treated per confidentiality agreements, and you should not use it to advise anyone other than the intended client; (d) You acknowledge that Srenova is not responsible for the advice you give to your clients and that you are acting independently. You agree to indemnify Srenova for any liability arising from claims by your clients that result from your advisory services (see Indemnity below).
- **Content and Communication**: All Users must use the communication tools on the Platform (messaging, comments, etc.) in a respectful and lawful manner. You are responsible for any Content you post. Do not post unauthorized personal information (doxing), adverts unrelated to a property, or any content violating third-party rights. Srenova reserves the right to moderate, edit, or remove content that violates these Terms or is deemed inappropriate, and to suspend or terminate accounts for serious offenses.

## 5. Listings, Transactions, and Role of Srenova

The Srenova Platform allows Property Sellers (directly or via Estate Agents) to list properties and related investment opportunities, and allows Institutional Investors to explore and potentially invest in or purchase those opportunities. It is important to understand how transactions are formed and Srenova's limited role:
- **Listing Information**: Property Sellers/Agents are solely responsible for the content of their listings. Srenova does not create the descriptions or verify all details of properties. While we may perform basic checks or require certain fields to be completed, we do not guarantee that listings are accurate, complete, or not misleading. Investors and IFAs should perform independent checks (for example, verifying property documents, valuations, etc.). If you spot an error in a listing, you can notify us or the lister, but Srenova is not the publisher of that content (we are an intermediary platform).
- **No Offer or Advice by Srenova**: Nothing on the Platform is intended to constitute an offer by Srenova to sell or a solicitation by Srenova to purchase any security or investment, nor an endorsement of any property by us. Any indication of interest or initiating a transaction is solely between the relevant users. Srenova does not provide investment advice or recommendations -- any decisions you make are at your discretion and risk. Institutional Investors should consult their own advisors. IFAs on the platform provide advice independently of Srenova (we are not responsible for their statements).
- **Due Diligence**: Srenova may implement certain preliminary due diligence (for instance, verifying the identity of a seller or requiring proof of ownership before listing, or verifying an investor's eligibility). However, Srenova is not a party to the actual property sale or investment contract. Buyers/Investors are expected to conduct their own due diligence on properties (title searches, inspections, etc.) and Sellers/Agents must conduct their due diligence on investors (such as knowing their funding capacity). Srenova might facilitate providing information (the Platform could host due diligence documents uploaded by a seller), but we do not verify those documents' authenticity. We encourage parties to use qualified professionals (lawyers, surveyors, notaries) for the formal parts of the transaction.
- **Negotiation and Agreements**: The Platform might provide tools for communication and even templated agreements (for example, a standard term sheet or LOI format), but the negotiation of terms (price, payment structure, completion timeline, conditions) is between the buyer (investor) and seller (with agent/IFA involvement as applicable). Any agreement reached (heads of terms, sale contract, investment agreement) is directly between those parties. Srenova is not an agent, lawyer, or representative for either side; we simply provide the digital space to facilitate the deal. Srenova does not hold client money or property on behalf of users (unless explicitly stated for a specific service, and then it would be under separate terms). For example, deposit payments would typically go through established escrow or solicitors' client accounts, not through Srenova's accounts.
- **Transaction Execution**: Once parties decide to proceed with a transaction, they will likely move off-platform to finalize it (for instance, signing a formal contract offline or via DocuSign, exchanging necessary legal documents, completing payment through bank transfers at closing, etc.). Srenova can assist by providing some workflow or reminders, but Srenova is not itself transferring property or money. The ultimate contract of sale or investment contract is outside the scope of these Terms (it's between buyer and seller under their chosen law, etc.). These Terms govern the use of the platform up to and including facilitating a connection and perhaps an initial agreement, but they do not replace the actual property sale contract. We strongly recommend that all significant transactions be formalized in writing with appropriate legal counsel.
- **No Warranty on Opportunities**: Each User acknowledges that investing in or selling property carries risk. Srenova makes no warranty that any property will increase in value, that any investor will perform their obligations, or that any deal arranged will ultimately close. All deals are contingent on the actual parties' performance and external factors (financing, legal clearance, etc.). Srenova is not liable for any deal that falls through or for any party's breach of their contractual obligations to each other.
- **Fees**: Srenova may charge fees for the use of the Platform. Any fees (and the party responsible for paying them) will be disclosed to you before you incur them, either in these Terms, on our website, or in a separate agreement or schedule. For example, Srenova might charge a listing fee to sellers/agents, or a success fee upon a completed transaction to one or more parties, or subscription fees for institutional access. Institutional Investors, for instance, might pay a subscription for advanced analytics access, while Agents might pay a monthly listing fee or a percentage of deals closed. All fees will be made clear (e.g., in a pricing page or individual agreement). Unless otherwise specified, fees are quoted exclusive of any applicable VAT or sales tax, which will be added if required by law. If you owe fees, you agree to pay them timely (if we invoice you or charge your card on file, etc.). Late payment may result in suspension of your account.
- **No Circumvention**: As the Platform facilitates introductions, we rely on the resulting transactions for our business model (fees, etc.). Therefore, you agree not to deliberately circumvent Srenova in any transactions that were initiated on our Platform. For example, if you met a seller through Srenova, you should not complete the purchase privately and attempt to avoid any platform success fees that would have applied. We do not restrict your freedom to contract, but if a fee was due to us for a platform-originated deal, you remain liable for it even if you complete off-platform. We trust our users to be ethical regarding this. We may include specific clauses in separate agreements to reinforce this no-circumvention requirement for certain professional users (like estate agents who sign a contract to list on Srenova).

## 6. Intellectual Property Rights

### 6.1 Srenova's Intellectual Property

All content and materials on the Platform provided by Srenova -- including the software, design, text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, and compilations of user content (e.g. arrangement of listings) -- are the intellectual property of Srenova or its licensors, protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. Srenova and associated logos are our trademarks (pending or registered). All rights are reserved.

We grant you a limited, revocable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive license to access and use the Platform and Srenova Content for the purpose of using the services as intended (i.e. listing properties, searching for opportunities, communicating with users). You may not: copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Platform or included content; reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of software (except as allowed by law); or use any trademarks of Srenova without our prior written consent.

If you need to use excerpts of Srenova Content for legitimate purposes (for example, downloading a sample report we provide, or printing a listing for offline discussion), that is allowed for personal/business use related to our services. However, you cannot republish or exploit Srenova's content commercially outside the Platform without permission.

### 6.2 User-Submitted Content and License to Srenova

Your Content: As a User, you may submit various content: property descriptions and photos (if you're a seller/agent), profile info, messages, documents in due diligence rooms, reviews or feedback, etc. We do not claim ownership of your original content. However, by providing content on the Platform, you grant Srenova a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable (to our service providers for display/distribution purposes), non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify (for formatting or technical purposes, not to change meaning), display, and distribute your content on the Platform and in marketing of the Platform. This license is solely for the purpose of operating and promoting the Platform, in accordance with your settings. For example, if you post a property listing, you give us the right to display it to all users, to crop/resize the photos as needed, to feature it in a promotional email or social media post about "new listings this week" (with attribution to you/your agency), etc. If you post a testimonial, we might quote it on our website. If you do not want your content used in certain ways, please do not post it or contact us to discuss limitations.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the content you upload (including permission from photographers for images, or from your company for logos, etc.), and that our use of your content in accordance with these Terms will not infringe any third-party rights. You also agree not to upload anything that violates privacy or data protection laws (e.g., personal data of others without consent, aside from basic business contact info in listings).

We reserve the right to remove or disable access to any user content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms or could harm the Platform or other users (for instance, if someone posts a picture containing hate speech, we would remove it; if an agent posts a property photo that is actually owned by another agency that complains, we might remove until the dispute is resolved). However, we are not obligated to monitor all content. Users remain responsible for their content.

### 6.3 Feedback

We welcome feedback, ideas, or suggestions ("Feedback") about improving Srenova. If you provide Feedback, you agree that we are free to use it without any restriction or compensation to you. We might incorporate your suggestions into our services or products. You agree that any Feedback you give is not confidential and can be used by us in any way. (This doesn't affect your own rights to use your idea if you independently develop it; it just means we have rights to the feedback you give us.)

### 6.4 Third-Party Intellectual Property

The Platform may contain content owned by other parties: for example, trademarks of property developers or institutions, content that users upload like building floorplans drawn by architects, or links to third-party websites. You must respect all intellectual property rights of third parties as well. If you believe that something on our Platform infringes your intellectual property (e.g. a user posted a photo that you own the copyright to without permission), please notify us via the contact information provided, with details of the infringement claim. We have procedures under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable laws to respond to IP infringement notices. We may remove or disable content alleged to infringe and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.

## 7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

### 7.1 No Warranty

**Platform "As Is"**: Srenova provides the Platform on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any warranties or representations of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. Use of the Platform is at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. We do not guarantee that: (a) the Platform will meet your specific requirements or expectations; (b) the Platform will be available uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; or (c) any information (including any content or listings) on the Platform will be accurate, reliable, complete, or current.

**Not Professional Advice**: No content or information on the Platform should be considered professional advice (legal, financial, investment, or otherwise). Srenova is not an investment advisor, broker, or estate agent to users; we are a facilitator. You should seek independent professional advice before making any decisions based on information from the Platform. We make no warranty regarding outcomes of using the Platform or engaging in transactions -- for example, we do not promise any particular return on investment or successful sale.

**User Interactions**: Srenova does not control or guarantee the actions of other users or the outcome of any transaction. Any dealings you have with other users (whether investors, sellers, agents, or IFAs) are at your own risk. We do not provide any warranty or assurance that a counterparty is creditworthy, licensed, or will perform as agreed. While we may do basic vetting, we cannot and do not confirm each user's identity or qualifications beyond what is stated in their profile or documents they submit (and we disclaim liability for any false statements by users). Always exercise caution and judgment when communicating or transacting with others.

**Third-Party Services**: The Platform may integrate or link to third-party services (for example, identity verification tools, mapping services, or document signing services). Srenova is not responsible for those third-party services, which are governed by their own terms. We don't warrant any results from third-party tools (like a valuation tool's accuracy).

### 7.2 Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, Srenova's total liability to you for any and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Platform shall be limited to the amount of fees you have paid to us in the 12 months immediately preceding the event that gave rise to the claim, or £100 GBP, whichever is greater. If you have not paid any fees (for example, if you're a free user and no transaction fees applied to you), our liability is capped at £100.

To the extent permitted by law, in no event will Srenova or its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, or agents be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, loss of data, loss of goodwill, business interruption, or the cost of substitute services, arising out of or in connection with your access to or use of (or inability to use) the Platform or any transaction facilitated by it. This limitation applies whether the claim is based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory, and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. For example, we are not liable for any loss of opportunity if a deal falls through, or any loss you suffer from reliance on incorrect information on a listing, or damages from a security breach unless our negligence was the primary cause.

**Specific Situations**: Without limiting the above, Srenova will not be liable for:
<ul className="ml-6">
  <li>any failure of a buyer or seller to complete a transaction, or disputes between users regarding a deal;</li>
  <li>any errors or omissions in a property listing or content provided by a user;</li>
  <li>any virus, malware, or harmful code acquired by using our Platform (we do our best to prevent such events, but cannot warrant 100% security);</li>
  <li>any action taken in response to violations of these Terms (like account suspension or content removal) -- for instance, if we remove your listing because of a complaint and you lose a potential deal, we aren't liable for that consequence if we were acting in good faith under these Terms.</li>
</ul>

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation/exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. If those laws apply to you, some of the disclaimers or limitations above may not apply to the extent prohibited. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in these Terms shall limit or exclude our liability for gross negligence, wilful misconduct, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law (for example, we do not exclude liability for personal injury or death caused by our negligence, and we do not exclude any remedies you may have under statute that cannot be waived).

### 7.3 Release

Because we are not directly involved in transactions between users, if you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Srenova (and our affiliates and personnel) from any and all claims, demands, and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes. For example, if you are an investor and you feel a seller misrepresented a property, that claim is between you and the seller -- you agree not to seek damages from Srenova for that issue. This release does not apply to any claim you might have against Srenova for its own breach of these Terms or statutory violation. If you are a California (USA) resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542 (which says a general release doesn't extend to unknown claims) -- basically, you are releasing even unknown claims in this context, in understanding that this encourages a dispute to be resolved between the actual parties to it.

## 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Srenova and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) that arise out of or relate to: (a) your use or misuse of the Platform, or any content you post; (b) your breach of these Terms or of any representation or warranty herein; (c) any transaction or attempted transaction in which you are involved via the Platform (for instance, any breach of contract or law by you in a sale, or any injury at a property viewing you arranged, etc.); or (d) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.

For example, if you are a seller and you post photos you didn't have rights to and the photographer sues Srenova, you agree to indemnify us for that claim. Or if you are an IFA and a client of yours sues Srenova alleging we gave them bad advice (when it was actually your advice), you'd indemnify us if we incur costs or liability due to that lawsuit.

We will: (i) promptly notify you of any such claim (provided that a delay in notification doesn't waive our rights unless it prejudices you); (ii) allow you to control the defense and settlement of the claim (so long as the settlement completely releases Srenova and doesn't impose unagreed obligations on us); and (iii) cooperate with you (at your expense) in the defense. We reserve the right to participate in the defence with counsel of our choosing, at our own cost, if we wish.

This indemnity obligation will survive termination of your use of the Platform or these Terms.

## 9. Account Suspension, Termination, and Remedies

### 9.1 By User

You may stop using the Platform at any time. If you wish to delete your account, you can do so by contacting us or using any account deletion feature available. Termination of your account will not prejudice any rights or obligations that have accrued prior to termination. If you engaged in a transaction before termination, relevant provisions (like any fee obligations or transaction commitments) may still bind you or be addressed by separate agreement.

### 9.2 By Srenova

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account or access to certain features at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms, violated applicable law, or if your use creates risk for us or other users (for instance, suspected fraud, security threat, or repeated inappropriate behaviour). We will try to provide notice or warnings when reasonable, but in urgent cases we may disable access immediately (e.g. if we suspect a hack or extreme abuse).

If your account is terminated for breach of Terms or unlawful conduct, you are not entitled to any refunds of fees you've paid (if any), and you must cease using the Platform. You may not create a new account if your old account was terminated by us for cause, without our prior written consent.

We also may decide to discontinue the Platform or any part thereof (though we'd likely give users advance notice to wind down activities). Srenova will not be liable to you for compensation or damages due to termination of your access in accordance with these Terms.

### 9.3 Effect of Termination

Upon termination of this Agreement:

- All licenses granted by Srenova to you will cease (you must stop using the Platform and any of our content).
- All licenses and rights you granted to Srenova in user content survive to the extent we may need to retain content for legal reasons or to maintain business records (for example, we may keep transaction records as needed).
- Sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination (such as Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing Law, etc.) will survive.
- If there are any outstanding fees due by you, termination does not excuse you from paying them; we reserve the right to invoice and collect even after account closure.
- If you were involved in an ongoing transaction at termination, we may notify other parties that you are no longer on the Platform, and they will have to decide how or whether to proceed outside the Platform.

## 10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

**Governing Law**: These Terms and any dispute or claim (contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, except as otherwise provided by mandatory consumer protection law (if you are using the Platform as a consumer in the EU, you may have certain rights under your local laws that cannot be waived by contract, in which case those local laws may apply to such extent). We choose English law because Srenova is UK-based. This choice of law will not deprive you of any protection afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement under the law of the country where you habitually reside, if that is in the UK or EU.

**Jurisdiction**: We both agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). However, if you are a consumer (not using Srenova for business purposes) and you reside in an EU member state, you may also bring proceedings in your home country and you may have the right to proceed in your local language and courts under EU consumer laws. Likewise, if required by an EU country's law, disputes may be resolved in that country's courts. For business users or where no consumer exception applies, English courts will be the venue.

**Cross-Border Acknowledgement**: Given Srenova's operations in the EU (France) and users in various locations, we recognize the jurisdiction of courts in those places as required by law. These Terms primarily pick UK law and courts, but we do not exclude any mandatory jurisdiction that might apply (for instance, an EU consumer's right to sue in their home country under Brussels I Regulation). We also note that we don't currently market outside UK/EU, but if a non-EU user uses the platform, they agree to English law/jurisdiction as above.

If any dispute arises, we encourage parties to attempt resolution through dialogue or mediation before resorting to litigation. You can always contact us to discuss any issue -- we will consider amicable resolution methods such as arbitration or mediation if both sides agree, but unless otherwise agreed, the above court jurisdiction stands.

## 11. Miscellaneous Provisions

### 11.1 Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other policies or guidelines incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Srenova regarding the Platform, and supersede any prior agreements or understandings (whether oral or written) relating to the same subject matter. Any additional agreement you may enter into with Srenova (e.g., a separate enterprise contract or referral agreement) will supplement these Terms; if there is a direct conflict, the specific agreement terms may prevail for that context.

### 11.2 No Agency

You and Srenova are independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, or franchisor-franchisee relationship. You have no authority to bind Srenova, and we have no authority to bind you, in any way. For example, even if you're an estate agent user, you are not an agent of Srenova; you're an agent for your clients and just a user of our Platform. We do not endorse any user and nothing in our relationship shall imply an endorsement.

### 11.3 No Third-Party Beneficiaries

These Terms do not confer any rights on any third party except as expressly provided. The contract is between you and Srenova. However, please note that our affiliates (like a subsidiary or parent company) are protected by the Limitation of Liability and Indemnity clauses as stated; those affiliates can enforce those provisions. Aside from that, a person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right to enforce any term of this Agreement under the UK Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise.

### 11.4 Assignment

You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any attempt to do so without consent will be null and void. Srenova may assign or transfer its rights and obligations (for instance, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, or sale of assets) to an affiliate or successor without your consent, provided that such assignment does not materially reduce the protections for the users' rights under these Terms. We will notify users of any such assignment if it results in a new entity managing the Platform.

### 11.5 Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. We agree to negotiate in good faith a valid, enforceable substitute provision that most nearly effects the original intent of the invalid provision. For example, if a liability limitation is deemed too broad, it will be narrowed only to the extent necessary to be legal, and the rest remains intact.

### 11.6 No Waiver

No failure or delay by Srenova in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude full exercise or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. In plain terms, if we don't enforce a particular provision right away, it doesn't mean we give up the right to enforce it later. A waiver of any provision must be in writing and signed by Srenova to be effective, and will apply only to the specific instance expressly stated.

### 11.7 Force Majeure

Srenova shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under these Terms if such failure or delay is caused by events beyond our reasonable control ("Force Majeure Event"). This can include, but is not limited to, natural disasters, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, government actions, national or regional emergencies, epidemic or pandemic, strikes or labour disputes (not involving our own workforce), power grid failures, or Internet disturbances. During a Force Majeure Event, our obligations are suspended to the extent affected. We will make reasonable efforts to mitigate effects and resume full performance as soon as possible. If a Force Majeure Event continues for an extended period (say, more than 30 days), either party may have the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice.

### 11.8 Notices

Any notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder:

- **From Srenova to You**: We may provide notices via the Platform (e.g. banner or notification), via email to the address associated with your account, or by postal mail/ courier to any address you have provided. You are responsible for keeping your contact info up to date. Legal notices (like notice of changes to Terms, or notice of termination) will typically be sent via email or certified mail.
- **From You to Srenova**: Notices to us should be sent by email to our official contact (for legal notices: [legal@srenova.com](mailto:legal@srenova.com), for general support: [support@srenova.com](mailto:support@srenova.com)) or by postal mail to our registered address provided in these Terms. If you have an urgent or sensitive legal notice, we recommend sending it to our registered office by recorded delivery with a copy by email.

Notices will be deemed given: (a) if by email, when the email is sent (provided no bounce or error notification was received); (b) if by platform notification, when you next log in and could reasonably see it; (c) if by postal mail, 2 business days after mailing within UK, or 5 business days if international.

### 11.9 Links to Other Sites

The Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources. These links are provided for convenience only. Srenova is not responsible or liable for the availability, content, products, services, or practices of third-party sites. If you click a third-party link (for example, a link to an external property listing site or a partner's site), you assume the risk. Our linking does not imply endorsement. Review the terms and policies of any third-party site you visit. Srenova will not be a party to any contract you enter on a third-party site.

### 11.10 Language

These Terms are written in English (British). If we provide any translation, it's for convenience, and the English version will govern in case of conflict. All communications will be in English unless we specifically provide translations. (For users in France or elsewhere, we might provide courtesy translations or bilingual support, but official legal terms remain in English for now.)
