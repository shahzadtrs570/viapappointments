## Introduction

Srenova (Estate Flex Ltd, Company No. 14936575), headquartered at 2a Station Road, Marlow, SL7 1NB, is committed to full compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the EU GDPR across its operations in the United Kingdom and France. This GDPR Policy outlines Srenova’s obligations, responsibilities, and procedures as both a Data Controller and a Data Processor in handling personal data. It is written in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (for UK) and the GDPR (EU Regulation 2016/679), and addresses how Srenova collects, uses, stores, and protects personal data. It also covers how Srenova facilitates data subject rights and responds to data breaches, ensuring compliance in both UK and EU jurisdictions. All Srenova employees, contractors, and partners are required to adhere to this policy.

## Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this policy is to establish clear guidelines and procedures to ensure Srenova meets its data protection obligations. It applies to all personal data processed by Srenova in its role as a provider of an estate investment platform, including data of consumers, institutional investors, property sellers, estate agents, and independent financial advisors (IFAs) using Srenova’s services. This policy covers processing activities in the UK and the EU (specifically France) and ensures compliance with both UK GDPR and EU GDPR requirements. It addresses Srenova’s dual role as a Data Controller (when Srenova determines the purposes and means of processing personal data) and as a Data Processor (when processing personal data on behalf of third-party controllers). The scope includes all categories of personal information handled by Srenova (financial, residential, identity data, etc.), all processing activities (collection, storage, transfer, destruction), and all IT systems or third parties involved in processing such data.

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Data Controller – Srenova**: In most instances, Srenova acts as the Data Controller for personal data collected through its platform and services. This means Srenova decides why and how personal data (e.g. user account information, property and investment details) are processed. As a controller, Srenova takes on the primary responsibility for complying with data protection principles and safeguarding individuals’ rights. Srenova is responsible for ensuring that any processing of personal data is lawful, fair, and transparent, and that it meets the requirements of UK/EU GDPR  .

**Data Processor – Srenova**: In certain cases, Srenova may act as a Data Processor handling personal data on behalf of another Data Controller. For example, if Srenova processes client data provided by estate agents or IFAs strictly under their instructions (such as facilitating a service where an estate agent inputs consumer data into the Srenova platform), Srenova would be acting as a processor. In such scenarios, Srenova will only process the data on documented instructions from the controller and in accordance with contractual obligations.

**Accountability**: Srenova acknowledges its accountability under the GDPR for both roles. When acting as controller, Srenova implements all required data protection measures and can demonstrate compliance (e.g. through maintaining records, conducting audits). When acting as processor, Srenova only uses personal data as instructed by the controller and helps the controller meet GDPR obligations. All staff and management at Srenova are responsible for understanding whether Srenova is controller or processor in any given context and for handling data accordingly. A designated Data Protection Officer or Data Protection Manager (if appointed) is responsible for overseeing compliance, advising on GDPR obligations, and serving as a point of contact for data protection matters in both the UK and EU.

## Personal Data Collected and Processed

Srenova collects and processes personal data relevant to its business of connecting property sellers, institutional investors, estate agents, and IFAs. The following categories of personal data are collected from data subjects (users and related individuals):

- **Identity Data**: Includes names, dates of birth, contact details (address, email, telephone number), and identification documents (such as passport, driver’s license or national ID number) for identity verification and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) purposes. This also may include employment status or professional credentials (e.g. if an IFA or institutional investor needs to provide proof of regulatory status).
- **Financial Data**: Includes financial information necessary for investment or property transactions. This can encompass income details, proof of funds, bank account details for payments, credit history or credit reference checks, investment history, and any relevant tax or accounting information. For institutional investors, this might include company financial statements or proof of funds; for individual investors or buyers, it might include salary or asset information if required by law or platform rules.
- **Residential and Property Data**: Includes personal addresses and property information. For property sellers, this includes details about the property being sold (address, ownership details, title documents, property valuation, etc.). For investors or buyers, this may include current residence address and past address history (for verification or credit purposes). It may also include information on property preferences or investment criteria.
- **User Account and Usage Data**: Includes login credentials, account profiles, and activity logs on the Srenova platform. This covers data like username, password (stored in hashed form), account settings, as well as records of user activity on the platform (e.g. searches performed, pages visited, dates of login) and communications through the platform (such as messages between investors and sellers or inquiries to estate agents).
- **Professional Data (for Estate Agents and IFAs)**: For estate agents, agency name, license or registration number, business contact information, and any credentials required to list properties on the platform. For IFAs, professional qualifications, firm details, and regulatory registration (if applicable) may be collected to verify their status.
- **Special Category Data**: Srenova’s policy is to avoid collecting special category data (such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, health, or biometric data) unless absolutely necessary. Srenova does not seek to collect such data about users in the normal course of business. If identity documents are collected, they may incidentally contain biometric data (e.g. a photograph on a passport could be considered biometric). Such data will only be processed for the purposes of uniquely identifying an individual (for fraud prevention or KYC) and in compliance with Article 9 GDPR (for example, under a substantial public interest exemption in anti-fraud laws or with explicit consent, as appropriate). Srenova will never collect special category data such as health or religion information unless required for a specific, lawful purpose and with proper safeguards.

**Sources of Data**: Personal data is collected directly from the individuals (data subjects) when they register on the platform, fill in forms, or upload documents. It may also be obtained indirectly: for example, an estate agent might input a property seller’s information with the seller’s authorization, or an IFA may provide details of an investor client. Additionally, Srenova may receive personal data from third-party sources for verification purposes – such as identity verification services, credit reference agencies, or public databases (e.g. checking a company’s registration). In all cases, Srenova ensures that the data collected is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed (data minimisation principle). Users are informed (via our Privacy Policy) about the personal data we collect and whether providing it is mandatory or optional, as well as the consequences of not providing mandatory data (for instance, inability to use certain services if key data is missing).

## Lawful Bases for Processing

Srenova will only process personal data where there is a valid lawful basis under Article 6 of the GDPR. We identify and document the lawful basis for each processing activity, ensuring that at least one of the following applies for every use of personal data:

- **Consent**: In certain cases, Srenova relies on the data subject’s consent. This will be used for specific, transparent purposes – for example, if we send direct marketing emails or newsletters to users or use cookies that require consent. Where consent is relied upon, it will be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous, obtained through a clear affirmative action (such as opting in). Users have the right to withdraw consent at any time, and we make it as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
- **Contractual Necessity**: Much of Srenova’s processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject, or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. For example, processing a property seller’s data and an investor’s data is necessary to provide our platform services that connect sellers with investors and facilitate transactions. When users sign up for the Srenova platform, a contract (the Terms & Conditions) is formed, and we must process their personal data (like account information, communications, transaction details) to deliver the services they expect. This also covers processing needed to take pre-contractual steps, such as evaluating an investor’s eligibility or responding to inquiries about a property listing.
- **Legal Obligation**: Srenova will process personal data where necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject. This includes obligations under UK or EU law, such as anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, “Know Your Customer” requirements, tax reporting laws, or responding to lawful requests by authorities. For instance, we may be legally required to collect and verify identity documents of investors (under anti-financial crime laws) or to retain transaction records for a certain period for compliance with financial regulations or law enforcement inquiries. When processing under legal obligation, we only do what the law mandates and will inform individuals where applicable (unless the law forbids such notice, e.g. a confidential law enforcement request).
- **Legitimate Interests**: In some cases, Srenova will process data on the basis of legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. This basis is used after careful assessment that Srenova’s legitimate interests are not overridden by individuals’ rights and interests. Examples include: improving and securing our platform (e.g. using data to debug issues or prevent fraud), internal analytics on platform usage to enhance user experience, communicating with our existing customers about similar services (direct marketing to our users, relying on the “soft opt-in” under PECR/ePrivacy where applicable, with the option to opt-out at any time), or facilitating the legitimate business interests of our platform participants (for example, sharing a property seller’s contact details with an interested institutional investor to facilitate a potential transaction, which is an expected part of using the platform). When using legitimate interests, Srenova will have conducted a Legitimate Interest Assessment to ensure fairness and will honour any objections from individuals when required by law (especially for marketing).
- **Other Bases (Vital Interests/Public Task)**: These bases are less likely to apply to Srenova’s activities. We do not generally process data under the “vital interests” basis except in truly life-or-death situations (which are unlikely in our context, e.g. if we needed to share information to prevent someone’s serious harm). Similarly, Srenova is not a public authority, so “public interest or exercise of official authority” is typically not applicable, except if we were ever tasked by an official body for a public interest project (not foreseen at this time).

For any Special Category Data (Article 9 GDPR) or Criminal Offence Data (Article 10 GDPR) that we might process (e.g. handling identification documents that contain biometric data like a photo, or processing data about criminal background if required for due diligence), Srenova will ensure an additional lawful condition under those Articles is met. This could include explicit consent from the individual, or reliance on a substantial public interest condition under Schedule 1 of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (for example, the prevention of fraud or money laundering, which is a legally authorized purpose), or other applicable conditions under EU law for special categories. These cases will be handled with greater safeguards (encryption, limited access) given the sensitive nature of the data.

Srenova maintains documentation of the lawful basis for each category of processing in our Records of Processing Activities. We also include the relevant lawful bases in our external Privacy Policy for transparency, so data subjects know on what grounds we process their information. If our purposes for processing change, we will either seek new consent (if consent was the original basis and the new purpose is incompatible) or ensure the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose under GDPR Article 6(4), or otherwise obtain a new lawful basis.

## Processing of Personal Data (Use and Purposes)

Srenova processes personal data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes. The purposes for which we process data include:

- **Providing Platform Services**: We use personal data to create user accounts, authenticate users, and enable the platform’s core functionality that connects property sellers, estate agents, IFAs, and institutional investors. For example, identity and contact data are used to register users and allow them to log in; property data is used to create listings viewable by investors; investor data is used to match investment opportunities. The platform cannot function without processing these data elements for the intended matchmaking and transaction facilitation purposes.
- **Facilitating Transactions**: When an institutional investor is interested in a property listing, Srenova may process and share relevant personal data between parties (e.g. sharing an investor’s identity and proof of funds with a property seller, and vice versa sharing a seller’s contact details and property information with the investor) to enable them to enter negotiations or contracts. This also involves processing any agreements or documentation through the platform and tracking the progress of deals.
- **Communication**: We process personal data to communicate with users about their accounts, transactions, and inquiries. This includes sending service emails (e.g. confirmations, notifications about a new message or offer, changes to terms or policies), responding to support requests, and facilitating communications between users (like messaging between an investor and an estate agent via the platform while keeping contact details secure until both parties are ready to share).
- **Identity Verification and Due Diligence**: We use identity and financial data to verify the identities and qualifications of users (especially institutional investors, who may need to be verified as accredited or qualified investors, and sellers, who must prove ownership or authority to sell a property). We also may run checks to comply with anti-money laundering and fraud prevention regulations. This could involve processing ID documents, running users against sanction or PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) lists through third-party services, and retaining evidence of verification.
- **Platform Improvement and Analytics**: Srenova processes usage data and feedback to improve the platform’s functionality, user interface, and services. For example, we may analyze usage patterns to optimize search algorithms for properties or to introduce new features. This is done in aggregate or pseudonymised form where possible (e.g. Google Analytics data on website usage, click rates on various listings, etc.), and always in compliance with privacy laws (analytics cookies, for instance, are only used with consent where required).
- **Marketing and Informational Updates**: With appropriate consent or lawful interest, we may use contact details to send users newsletters, market reports, new investment opportunities, or updates about Srenova’s services. For instance, an institutional investor user might receive an email about a new property portfolio available on the platform. Such communications will always offer a clear opt-out (unsubscribe) mechanism. We will not spam and will follow ePrivacy rules (PECR in the UK, and the ePrivacy Directive implementation in France) for electronic marketing, sending such communications only to those who have consented or who are existing clients under the soft opt-in exception (and not opted out).
- **Third-Party Integrations**: If Srenova integrates third-party tools or services (for example, a digital signature service for contracts, or a mapping service for property locations), personal data might be processed through those services strictly to fulfil user-requested actions. In doing so, Srenova ensures such third parties are bound by data protection obligations (see “Third-Party Processors” below) and that data is not used for secondary purposes by them.
- **Legal Compliance and Defences**: We will process personal data as needed to comply with legal obligations (discussed above) and also to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. For example, we may retain logs of user activity or communications if we believe it’s necessary to resolve future disputes or defend against potential legal claims. If required by court order or legal process, we may process (e.g. review, compile) and disclose relevant data to the extent lawfully compelled.
- **Security Monitoring and Fraud Prevention**: Srenova processes data to monitor and ensure the security of our platform and users’ accounts. This includes automated processing such as IP address monitoring, device identification, login pattern analysis to detect suspicious activity (like possible hacking attempts), and using cookies or similar technologies to enable security features (e.g. to prevent cross-site request forgery or to log out inactive sessions). We may suspend or terminate accounts or report activities if we detect unlawful behaviour, in line with this policy and our Terms.
- **Internal Administration**: We process data for general business administration, such as maintaining our company records, accounting and financial reporting (which might involve processing transaction data or payment records associated with personal data), and training of staff using anonymised real-world scenarios. Access to personal data for these administrative purposes is tightly controlled and limited to need-to-know.

Srenova ensures purpose limitation: personal data collected for one purpose will not be used for a new, incompatible purpose without obtaining a new legal basis. If we ever consider processing data for a purpose not originally communicated (for example, wanting to conduct research or develop new services using historical data), we will either anonymise the data or ensure the new purpose is compatible under GDPR or seek consent if required. Our Privacy Policy provided to users enumerates these purposes in clear language, and we stick to those stated purposes in practice.

## Third-Party Processors and Data Sharing

Srenova uses third-party service providers (processors) and also may share data with other data controllers under certain circumstances. All such third-party engagements are governed by strict data protection and security standards:

**Engagement of Data Processors**: When Srenova engages a third-party company to process personal data on our behalf (for example, a cloud hosting provider, an email delivery service, identity verification service, or payment processing gateway), we do so under a binding Data Processing Agreement (DPA) as required by Article 28 GDPR. We only use processors that provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in line with GDPR. This means we vet our service providers for robust security practices and GDPR compliance. The DPA contracts mandate confidentiality, limited processing purposes (they can only process Srenova’s data as instructed for the specified purposes), and include all required clauses per GDPR Article 28(3) (such as obligations to assist with data subjects’ rights requests, breach notification to Srenova, etc.). Srenova remains liable for and supervises the performance of our processors. Examples of processors we use include:
- **Cloud Infrastructure Providers**: (e.g. secure cloud servers or data centres where our platform and database are hosted). These providers store and transmit personal data under encryption and robust security, but cannot access data except for troubleshooting under our instruction.
- **Email and Communication Services**: to send transactional emails or support communications to users. They act on our behalf to deliver messages and may process contact data for that purpose.
- **Identity Verification Services**: third-party tools or agencies that verify ID documents or run anti-money laundering checks on our behalf. They receive the necessary identity data and documents and provide verification results, under strict confidentiality.
- **Analytics and Marketing Tools**: (if used) such as analytics platforms that process usage data or marketing platforms that handle email lists – always configured to only use data for Srenova’s purposes and not for their own marketing. For analytics involving personal data or online identifiers, we anonymise or seek consent where required.
- **IT Support and Developers**: If we outsource certain IT development or support tasks, those contractors may have access to personal data in our systems. They are bound by DPAs and confidentiality obligations as processors as well.

In all cases, Srenova remains the controller and ensures processors do not sub-process data to further third parties without permission. We maintain an up-to-date list of our key processors which can be provided upon request (and in our Privacy Policy we inform users of categories of processors). Srenova’s policy is to use only processors with proven compliance certifications or reputations (for example, ISO 27001 certification for cloud providers or firms that have adopted approved codes of conduct) whenever feasible. We audit or request assurances from major processors periodically.

**Sharing with Other Third-Party Controllers**: Srenova may also share personal data with third parties who are not acting merely as processors, but as independent or joint controllers, in certain scenarios:

- **Counterparties to Transactions**: When a property seller and an investor agree to proceed with a transaction, each party will necessarily receive personal data about the other (e.g. names, contact details, perhaps proof of identity or funds). At that stage, Srenova facilitates the exchange of this data with the users’ consent or as part of the contract with them. Each party then becomes a controller of the data it received (using it for conducting due diligence on the other, drafting sale contracts, etc.). Srenova informs users that such data sharing is inherent to using the platform when a deal progresses. We ensure that only the necessary information is shared.
- **Professional Advisors and Institutions**: We might share data with lawyers, notaries, or escrow agents involved in a property transaction, or with banks handling payments, as required to consummate a deal. These parties would be controllers for the information we provide to them (e.g. a lawyer receiving a copy of a seller’s ID for drafting a contract). We only do this with a lawful basis (performance of the contract or legal obligation) and ideally with notice to the individuals.
- **Group Companies or Affiliates**: If Srenova operates through affiliates or has a parent company or subsidiaries in the EU, personal data might be shared internally for administrative purposes. All group entities are bound to the same GDPR obligations. If, for instance, Srenova has a branch or affiliate in France handling French operations, data may be shared between the UK headquarters and French branch as joint controllers, under an intra-group data sharing agreement consistent with GDPR requirements.
- **Legal or Regulatory Disclosure**: If required by law, Srenova will share personal data with regulatory authorities, government agencies, or law enforcement. For example, reporting a suspicious transaction to the UK National Crime Agency or to the French TRACFIN (anti-money laundering authority), or responding to a court order or an inquiry from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) or the CNIL (French data protection authority). In these cases, Srenova will verify the legitimacy of the request and only disclose the minimum necessary data. The third party receiving it (e.g. a government body) will then be responsible for that data as a controller under their own legal regime.

In all sharing contexts, Srenova adheres to the principle of data minimisation – only the data needed for the purpose is shared. We also keep records of data disclosures (what was shared, to whom, and why) to maintain accountability. Where required, we will inform the data subjects of such sharing (particularly if it’s not obvious or expected, unless legally restricted from informing them).

Furthermore, confidentiality is maintained by all who handle Srenova personal data. Our employees and contractors are bound by confidentiality agreements. Third-party recipients are either under contract (processors) or under professional obligations (e.g. lawyers) or legal duties (authorities) to keep data confidential.

**Due Diligence on Third Parties**: Before engaging any new data processor or significant service provider, Srenova conducts due diligence to assess their data protection posture. This may include reviewing their privacy policies, security certifications, past audit reports or breach history, and ensuring a GDPR-compliant contract is in place. For high-risk processing, we may require the third party to undergo a security assessment or provide penetration testing results. Srenova also monitors key processors’ performance and compliance over time (e.g. reviewing their Sub-processor lists, making sure they handle data subject requests forwarded to them properly, etc.).

## International Data Transfers
Srenova operates in both the UK and the EU (France), which involves cross-border data flows. We are committed to ensuring that any transfer of personal data outside of the jurisdiction in which it originated complies with Chapter V of the GDPR (and corresponding UK GDPR provisions) regarding international transfers. Our approach to international data transfers is as follows:

- **UK–EU Data Transfers**: Personal data moves freely between the UK and EU in Srenova’s operations. The EU has formally recognised the UK as providing adequate data protection (via an EU Commission adequacy decision in 2021), meaning data can flow from the EEA to the UK as if it were within the EU. Conversely, the UK has designated EEA countries (including France) as adequate under UK law. Srenova relies on these adequacy decisions for routine UK–EU transfers. We nevertheless safeguard such data and treat EU-origin data per EU GDPR and UK-origin data per UK GDPR to maintain high standards. If the adequacy status between UK and EU were to change, Srenova will implement alternate transfer safeguards immediately to ensure continuity of lawful data flows.
- **Transfers Outside UK/EEA**: If Srenova needs to transfer or allow access to personal data to any country outside the UK and EEA that is not deemed “adequate” by the UK government or European Commission, we will ensure an appropriate transfer mechanism is in place in line with GDPR requirements. In the absence of an adequacy decision, GDPR permits transfers only if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards. Srenova’s policy is typically to use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) adopted by the European Commission (and the UK’s International Data Transfer Addendum or UK Transfer Clauses, as applicable) as the primary safeguard for such transfers. For example, if we use a U.S.-based cloud backup service or a developer in India needs limited access for support, we will execute SCCs with them, which contractually bind the recipient to GDPR-level data protection and give data subjects enforceable rights. We will also assess on a case-by-case basis whether supplementary measures are needed (e.g. encryption in transit and at rest, pseudonymisation before transfer, commitments from the importer regarding government access requests) in light of the Schrems II decision to ensure transferred data remains protected.
- **Other Safeguards**: In some cases, we may rely on Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) if transferring within a corporate group (not currently applicable unless Srenova expands and adopts BCRs) or approved Codes of Conduct or Certification mechanisms if our industry or partners provide them (currently, we use SCCs as the most straightforward tool). In rare situations, we might rely on GDPR derogations under Article 49 for specific transfers (e.g. explicit consent from the individual for the transfer, or transfer necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual, or for establishment of legal claims) – but these are used only as last resort and on a case-by-case basis, not for routine transfers.
- **Data Location and Access**: We aim to store personal data on servers located in the UK or EEA whenever feasible. Our primary databases and application servers are, for example, located in secure facilities in the UK or EU. If we utilize global cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, or similar), we will choose EU/UK data centre regions for hosting. We control administrative access so that support personnel outside UK/EU (if any) only access data remotely under controlled conditions and pursuant to SCCs or equivalent arrangements.
- **Documentation and Transparency**: Srenova keeps records of our data transfer arrangements. Our Records of Processing detail which systems or services involve international transfers and under what legal mechanism. In our Privacy Policy, we inform users about cross-border data transfers, naming the relevant safeguards (e.g. that we use SCCs for certain processors in the United States). We will provide copies of or information on the transfer safeguards to data subjects on request (subject to redacting commercial or security-sensitive information).
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: We stay updated on legal developments around international transfers. If the EU–UK adequacy decision is amended, or if new SCCs or UK transfer mechanisms are introduced, or if there are legal challenges (such as changes post-Schrems II), we will adapt promptly. For instance, should the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (if applicable) be in effect and cover our US transfers, we may rely on that adequacy decision once confirmed, but still with caution. Our Data Protection Officer (or responsible manager) will periodically review the status of all international transfers to ensure compliance.

In summary, Srenova will not transfer personal data internationally in a manner that undermines the level of protection guaranteed by UK/EU GDPR. Whether data is moving from London to Paris, or London to New York, we apply consistent high standards and legal safeguards to protect individuals’ information across borders.

## Data Subject Rights and Requests

Under the GDPR, individuals (data subjects) have robust rights regarding their personal data. Srenova recognizes all these rights and has established procedures to ensure we can respond effectively and within legal timeframes. The rights include:

- **Right to be Informed**: Individuals have the right to receive clear and transparent information about how their data are processed, typically through privacy notices. Srenova fulfils this via our comprehensive Privacy Policy (covering all information required by Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, such as our identity, the purposes of processing, data retention, transfer details, rights, etc.). We provide this information at the point of data collection (e.g. link to Privacy Policy during sign-up) and whenever there are significant changes.
- **Right of Access**: Individuals have the right to access their personal data and receive a copy, as well as supplementary information about the processing (similar to what is provided in the privacy notice). Upon a Subject Access Request (SAR), Srenova will verify the requester’s identity and then search our records for personal data pertaining to that individual. We will provide a copy of the data and relevant information (such as the purposes of processing, categories of data, recipients to whom data has been disclosed, storage period, and details of rights) in an intelligible form. We will also include any information available about the source of the data (if not collected from the individual) and if any automated decision-making with significant effects is involved (which in our case, there is none without human involvement). Normally, access is provided electronically in a secure format (e.g. a PDF report or via secure account download) unless the individual requests otherwise. Srenova does not charge a fee for SARs, except if requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (in which case we may charge a reasonable administrative fee or refuse to act, as permitted by law).
- **Right to Rectification**: If any personal data we hold is inaccurate or incomplete, the data subject has the right to have it corrected. Srenova allows users to correct/update certain information themselves via their account settings (e.g. update contact information). For other data that users cannot edit (for instance, verification data or data on closed transactions), they can contact us with a rectification request. We will promptly correct verified inaccuracies and confirm to the individual that we have done so. If we have shared incorrect data with others, we will (where possible) inform those parties of the correction.
- **Right to Erasure (Right to be “Forgotten”)**: Individuals may request deletion of their personal data in certain circumstances – for example, if the data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected, if the person withdraws consent (and no other legal basis applies), or if they object to processing and we have no overriding legitimate grounds, or if the data was processed unlawfully. Srenova will assess erasure requests case by case. We will honour valid erasure requests by securely deleting the data in question (and instructing processors to do the same) unless retention is required by law or another legitimate reason (e.g. we might need to keep certain transaction records for compliance or legal claims defence, in which case we will inform the requester of that exemption). We also note that complete erasure of an account might not be immediate if data must be retained in backups for a short period or in logs for system integrity – but these will be erased according to our retention policy. Importantly, if data has been made public via our platform (unlikely, as personal data is not public on our site except perhaps names in listings), we will take reasonable steps to inform other controllers processing that data to also erase references, where required by GDPR Article 17.
- **Right to Restriction of Processing**: Individuals can request us to restrict processing of their data in certain scenarios – e.g. while a claim of inaccuracy is being resolved, or if processing is unlawful but they prefer restriction to deletion, or if we no longer need the data but they need it for a legal claim, or if they have objected to processing and await verification of overriding grounds. When restriction is applied, Srenova will mark the data as restricted and only process it for storage, with the individual’s consent, for legal claims, or for important public interest reasons. For example, if a user contests the accuracy of their financial data we hold, we would stop using that data for any decisions until verified. We have mechanisms to flag restricted accounts/data so that no one in Srenova accidentally continues normal processing until the restriction is lifted.
- **Right to Data Portability**: For data that individuals have provided to Srenova, and which we process by automated means on the basis of consent or contract, individuals have the right to obtain that data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, and have the right to transmit that data to another controller. In practice, this right likely applies to profile information and transaction history a user has input on our platform. Upon request, Srenova will export such data (for example, in CSV or JSON format) and provide it to the individual, or transmit it directly to a new provider if technically feasible and if the individual so wishes. We ensure the data export includes all relevant personal information that the user has provided or that was observed from their activity (e.g. list of properties they inquired about, etc.), excluding data that is purely our derived analytics or internal assessments. We do this free of charge within one month of request.
- **Right to Object**: Individuals have the right to object to certain processing of their personal data. They can object at any time to processing for direct marketing – if Srenova uses personal data to send marketing, we will immediately stop using the data for that purpose upon an objection (and as a policy, we provide easy opt-out links in all marketing correspondence). Additionally, individuals can object to processing based on legitimate interests or public interest tasks. In such cases, we will review the objection and if we cannot demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override the individual’s rights and interests, we will cease the processing in question. For example, if an investor objects to us using their data for internal analytics because they feel it unduly affects their privacy, we will either stop including their data in analytics or provide a justification why our interest overrides (which would be rare; usually we would respect the objection). Note that if the individual’s data is being processed for legal compliance or other exempt purposes, the right to object may not apply.
- **Rights related to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling**: Srenova does not currently make any decisions about individuals that are solely automated and produce legal or similarly significant effects (e.g. no fully automated credit approval or user scoring without human oversight). If we ever introduce automated profiling (for example, an algorithm that ranks investors for a particular opportunity), we will ensure GDPR Article 22 is complied with, including transparency about the logic and ensuring individuals can request human review or express their point of view. Users would also have the right to object to purely automated decisions. At this time, any important decision (such as approving a user’s qualification as an investor or deciding to remove a user for misuse) involves human review.

**Exercising Rights**: Data subjects can exercise their rights by contacting Srenova through the designated channels (see “Contact” at the end of this policy). For efficiency, we accept rights requests via email or webform. Upon receiving a request, Srenova will log it in our Data Subject Request register. We will verify the identity of the requester (to avoid unauthorized access or changes), which might involve asking for additional information or identification if we are unsure of the requester’s identity (especially for access or deletion requests). Once verified, we will evaluate the request against any applicable exemptions (for example, we cannot delete data that must be retained by law, etc.). Then we will proceed to fulfil the request and respond to the individual.


**Response Timeframes**: Srenova will respond to data subject requests without undue delay, and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request (or receipt of any information needed to verify identity or clarify the request). We understand this one-month deadline is a maximum, not a routine target, and we strive to handle requests as quickly as possible. If a request is complex or numerous, we may extend the deadline by an additional two months as permitted by GDPR; if so, we will inform the individual within the first month and explain why the extension is necessary. For example, if a user requested a very large amount of data and simultaneously asked for rectification of many items, an extension might be justified. We will always inform the requester of the outcome of their request – either providing the information/action requested or, if we are refusing (wholly or partly) due to a legal exemption, we will explain the refusal and inform them of their right to complain to a supervisory authority.

**No Fee Policy**: In most cases, we do not charge any fee for handling data subject rights requests. However, GDPR allows a reasonable fee (or refusal) if requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (particularly if repetitive).

**Subject Access Requests (Detailed Procedure)**: Because Subject Access Requests (SARs) are common and important, Srenova has a detailed procedure for them:
- SARs can be made by email to our contact address or by physical mail to our company address. We also treat any clear request for data (even if not using legal terms) as a SAR – users do not have to use a special form. Our staff is trained to recognize SARs.
- We log the date of receipt and deadline. We verify identity if needed (for example, if request comes from a non-registered email, or asks for sensitive data, we may ask for proof of ID). The one-month clock starts once identity is confirmed if we had to ask.
- We clarify the scope of the request if it’s unclear (e.g. if someone says “give me all my data”, we will interpret broadly; but if they only want certain data, we may ask if they want everything or something specific, to provide a better service). However, individuals are not obliged to narrow the scope, and we will comply with broad requests fully.
- We assign responsible personnel to retrieve data from all systems: databases, email archives, support tickets, logs, etc., relating to that individual. We compile the data carefully, excluding data that is not the requester’s personal data or that involves others (if it involves others’ data, we might redact those parts to protect third-party privacy, unless the third-party has consented or it’s reasonable to disclose).
- We prepare a response that includes the data (in a user-friendly format) and an accompanying letter explaining the categories of data, purposes of processing, recipients, retention period or criteria, and the rights (essentially mirroring what Article 15 GDPR requires). We also include the source of data if not from the user (e.g. “your estate agent submitted this info on your behalf on X date”), and confirm whether or not we are processing data about them (if we found nothing, we would say so).
- Before sending, we have a quality check to ensure no internal codes or third-party confidential info is inadvertently included and that we are not omitting any data that should be provided.
- We then deliver it securely (usually to the email on record, encrypted if the data is sensitive, or via a secure portal). We inform the individual that they can request further information or make a complaint if unsatisfied.
- We log completion of the SAR. If the individual has subsequent requests (like asking for data in a different format for portability or correcting something they saw in the SAR), we handle those accordingly.

By following this procedure, Srenova ensures compliance with the access right and maintains an audit trail. Notably, GDPR requires that information provided to a data subject be in concise and plain language – even though this internal policy is detailed, our actual communication to users (in the Privacy Policy or response letters) will be in clear, non-legalistic language.

**Right to Lodge a Complaint**: In all our communications regarding data subject rights, Srenova informs individuals of their right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if they believe we have not complied with their data protection rights. Specifically, UK individuals can complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and EU individuals (or those in France) can complain to the CNIL or their local Data Protection Authority. We provide contact details for these authorities in our Privacy Policy and response letters. We encourage individuals to come to us first to resolve any issues, but we make clear their right to approach regulators is intact. Additionally, individuals have the right to an effective judicial remedy if they consider their rights infringed, which means they could take legal action against Srenova or a processor – being “litigation-grade,” our policy aims to minimize that risk by full compliance and cooperation.

In summary, Srenova fully respects the rights of data subjects and has put in place the processes, resources, and training necessary to respond to rights requests in a timely and legally compliant manner. All staff are made aware that a data subject request should be treated with priority, and our data systems are structured such that we can search and extract personal data efficiently to meet these obligations.

## Data Security and Breach Response

Srenova takes the security of personal data very seriously. We maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information against unauthorised or unlawful processing, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, as required by GDPR Article 32. Our security framework includes:

- **Access Control**: Access to personal data within Srenova is strictly limited on a need-to-know basis. Employee and contractor accounts are role-based, with privileges granted only as necessary for their job function. Administrative access to databases or servers is logged and requires strong authentication (such as multi-factor authentication). We segregate duties so that no single individual has full control over critical systems without oversight.
- **Encryption**: Personal data is encrypted in transit and at rest wherever feasible. For example, our databases use disk encryption, and sensitive fields (like passwords, identification numbers, bank details) may be additionally encrypted or hashed at the application level. All web communication with the platform is forced over HTTPS/TLS. If we transfer data on portable media or backups, those are encrypted.
- **Secure Development Practices**: Our IT development follows secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, XSS, etc.). We regularly update software and apply security patches to servers and applications. Before major releases, we conduct testing (including security testing).
- **Network Security**: Firewalls protect our network perimeter, and continuous monitoring systems detect and alert on suspicious activities or intrusions. We use anti-malware protection on endpoints and servers. If using cloud infrastructure, we employ cloud security best practices (like security groups, limited API keys, etc.).
- **Data Minimisation and Pseudonymisation**: Where possible, we minimise the use of personal data in non-production environments. For example, if we use real data for testing, we anonymise or pseudonymise it. We avoid storing highly sensitive data if not needed. If a user closes their account, we eventually delete or anonymise their personal data (after any retention period) to reduce risk.
- **Physical Security**: Our offices and any data centres we use have physical security controls (badge access, CCTV, visitor logs). Paper records (if any) containing personal data are locked in cabinets and shredded when no longer needed.
- **Staff Training and Policies**: All Srenova personnel are trained on data protection and information security best practices. We have an internal Data Protection Policy and IT Security Policy that staff must follow. This includes guidelines on using strong passwords, securing devices, handling personal data in emails, etc. Regular training sessions and awareness reminders are provided, so security and privacy remain top-of-mind. Staff also know how to spot and report potential security incidents or phishing attempts.
- **Vendor Security**: We ensure that our third-party processors (as discussed) also employ adequate security. We often review their certifications or ask them to fill out security questionnaires. Key partners like hosting providers typically have industry-standard security attestations (ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc.).

Despite robust measures, Srenova recognises that security incidents can still occur. Therefore, we have in place a Data Breach Response Plan to handle any personal data breaches promptly and effectively:

**Definition of Breach**: A personal data breach is defined as any security incident leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. This includes both electronic and physical incidents (e.g. a lost laptop, misdirected email, hack, malware infection, or insider misuse).
**Internal Reporting**: Upon notification of a potential breach, Srenova’s incident response team will quickly assess the situation. Steps include:
- Containing the breach (e.g. isolating compromised systems, changing access codes, shutting off a feature if it’s leaking data).
- Initial assessment of scope: determining what data is affected, how many individuals, what categories of data (sensitive or not), and whether the breach is ongoing. We document everything as we go.
- Fixing the vulnerability or issue that caused the breach (e.g. apply a patch, disable a compromised account).
- Initiating a forensic investigation if needed, possibly with the help of specialized IT security consultants, to understand exactly what happened and ensure it’s fully resolved.
**Risk Evaluation**: We evaluate the risks to individuals as a result of the breach. Under GDPR, not every breach is notifiable to authorities or individuals – only if it’s likely to result in a risk (or high risk) to individuals’ rights and freedoms. We consider factors like: the type of data (e.g. contact info vs. identity documents or financial info), whether it was encrypted, who obtained it or could have obtained it, and potential consequences (identity theft, fraud, reputational harm, etc.). We document this risk analysis.
**Notification to Supervisory Authority**: If the breach is likely to result in a risk to individuals (even if not a “high risk”), Srenova will notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. For UK data subjects, we notify the ICO; for EU data subjects (e.g. French users) we notify the CNIL or the lead authority under the GDPR one-stop-shop if applicable. If 72 hours is exceeded, we will include reasons for delay (but we strive to notify within the deadline). Our breach notification to the authority will include all required information that we have at the time, per GDPR Article 33: a description of the nature of the breach (categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected), contact details of our data protection officer or incident lead, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken or proposed to address it including any mitigation. If we do not yet have full information (which is common within 72 hours), we will send an initial notification and provide supplemental information as it becomes available. We also understand that processors (if a breach occurs on a processor’s side) must notify Srenova (the controller) without undue delay; we enforce this in our contracts and will act on any such notification immediately.
**Notification to Affected Individuals**: If a data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected individuals (for example, a leak of financial information that could lead to fraud, or loss of sensitive personal details), Srenova will also communicate the breach to the affected individuals without undue delay. This communication will be in clear language describing the nature of the breach and providing specific advice to protect themselves (e.g. reset passwords, watch out for scams) and what we are doing to assist. We include our contact details and likely the DPO’s contact in that notice. We may not notify individuals only if an exemption applies – e.g. if we have since mitigated the risk (like rendering data unintelligible through encryption), or if notifying would involve disproportionate effort (in which case we’d do a public communication instead), or if the high risk threshold isn’t met. Our default, however, is to err on the side of informing individuals if there is any significant potential harm, as we value transparency and user trust.
**Documentation**: Srenova documents all personal data breaches, regardless of whether they had to be notified or not, in our Breach Register. This log includes the facts about the breach, its effects, and the remedial action taken. This helps us track incidents and is required so that regulators can verify our compliance. Even minor incidents (like an email with minor personal data sent to the wrong agent but immediately deleted) are recorded with details of analysis and outcome.
**Remedial Action**: After containment and initial notifications, we focus on remediation: closing the security gaps, recovering lost data if possible, and preventing recurrence. For instance, if a breach occurred due to a coding error, we not only fix that error but also audit similar areas of the codebase. If it was due to human error, we consider if more training or process changes are needed. In addition, we might offer support to affected users – for example, if their login was compromised, we assist them in changing credentials; if identity data leaked, we might provide guidance on protecting against identity theft or even services like credit monitoring (if appropriate).
**Evaluation and Learning**: Post-incident, we conduct a root cause analysis and a “lessons learned” session. The GDPR team, IT, and relevant managers review how the incident was handled and what improvements can be made. We update our policies and response plans accordingly. Senior management is kept informed of breaches and their resolution, and significant incidents are reported to the board of directors.
**Breach Response in Multi-Jurisdiction**: Because Srenova operates in UK and France, we consider where and how to notify. If a breach involves individuals in multiple EU countries, we may coordinate with multiple authorities (through the one-stop-shop mechanism if applicable, determining our lead authority). Our communications to individuals will be provided in appropriate languages if necessary (e.g. in French for French data subjects).

Through these measures, Srenova aims to not only comply with the letter of GDPR’s breach notification rules but also to maintain the trust of our users by reacting swiftly and responsibly to any security issues. Our goal is to minimise the likelihood of breaches via strong preventive security, and to limit damage if one occurs via effective response.

## Data Retention and Disposal

Srenova adheres to the principle that personal data should not be kept for longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. We have a Data Retention Policy that defines retention periods for various categories of data, taking into account legal requirements and business needs:
- **Account Data**: For active users of the platform, we retain personal data for as long as the account remains active and the user continues to use our services. Users can also choose to close their account. Upon account closure (either at user request or due to inactivity or termination), we will archive the data for a defined retention period (for example, 6 years from closure) to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements (this period is often chosen to align with statutes of limitation for contracts or fraud claims, and financial record retention laws). During this retention period, the data is not used for new purposes, only stored. After this period, personal data will be securely deleted or anonymised. Anonymisation means we may keep some transactional records without personal identifiers for statistical purposes.
- **Transaction Records**: Details of property transactions or investments facilitated through Srenova may have specific retention needs. For instance, under UK anti-money laundering laws, certain customer due diligence records must be kept for 5 years after the end of the business relationship or transaction. Similarly, contractual records may need to be kept for a number of years for legal reasons. Srenova complies with such laws, meaning property sale agreements or investment contracts and related identity verification data will be retained at least for the minimum time required (often 5-6 years). We will securely dispose of them after that period unless further retention is justified (e.g. ongoing legal proceedings).
- **Communications**: Customer support correspondence or chats on the platform are retained for a certain period (say 2 years) in case of follow-up issues or disputes, then deleted unless needed longer. General inquiries that do not result in an account are usually deleted after a short period (like 1 year).
- **Marketing Data**: If an individual has consented to receive marketing, we retain their contact details until they unsubscribe or the consent is otherwise withdrawn, or if we notice emails consistently bounce. If they opt-out, we may keep minimal information (email address) on a suppression list to ensure we respect the opt-out going forward.
- **Website Analytics**: Data collected via cookies and similar are retained as per our Cookie Policy. For example, Google Analytics data might be retained 14 months in analytics tool settings, after which it gets deleted automatically.
- **Legal Requirement Overrides**: Certain data might be retained longer if required by law – e.g. tax law may require retention of invoicing records for 6+ years. Also, if we receive a preservation order or notice of litigation, we will preserve relevant data until it’s resolved. We integrate such requirements into our schedule.

We regularly review the data we hold. Our systems may have automated routines to flag or delete data that exceeds its retention period. For instance, a cron job might purge accounts that have been inactive for X years (after sending reminders). When deleting data, we ensure it is done securely – e.g. permanent deletion from databases, shredding of paper, and rendering data unrecoverable from storage (beyond simply “deleting”, possibly using secure erase or encryption key destruction).

When deleting data, we ensure it is done securely – e.g. permanent deletion from databases, shredding of paper, and rendering data unrecoverable from storage (beyond simply “deleting”, possibly using secure erase or encryption key destruction).

When personal data is deleted from primary systems, we also consider backups. Our backup policy ensures that old backups (which might contain data past its retention) are also rotated out and securely destroyed in a timely manner. There may be a slight lag due to backup retention (e.g. if weekly backups are kept for 3 months, data could persist for that duration after deletion request before backup expiry), but we keep this within reasonable bounds and do not restore old data unless absolutely necessary for disaster recovery.

Srenova’s Privacy Policy transparently informs users about how long we generally keep their data. If a user wants, for example, to have their data deleted sooner and no law prevents it, we honor those requests (as part of the right to erasure).

By enforcing these retention limits, Srenova reduces risk (older data that’s no longer needed is a liability) and ensures we’re not unnecessarily processing stale personal information. We also periodically audit data stores to identify if we are retaining anything we shouldn’t and take corrective action. All staff are instructed: when in doubt, securely dispose of data that has outlived its purpose and isn’t subject to an exemption.

## Accountability and Governance

Srenova maintains a strong governance framework for data protection, ensuring that we can demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles (accountability principle – Article 5(2) GDPR). Key elements include:

- **Record of Processing Activities**: We maintain a detailed Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) as required by Article 30 GDPR for both our controller activities and processor activities. This record lists each processing purpose, the categories of data subjects and personal data, the categories of recipients, any international transfers (and safeguards in place), retention schedules, and a general description of technical and organisational security measures. This document is reviewed and updated regularly (especially when we launch new features or change processes). It can be made available to the ICO or CNIL upon request to demonstrate our compliance structure.
- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Given the nature of our processing (financial and identity data across borders), Srenova has appointed a Data Protection Officer (or, if not legally required, at least a person with equivalent responsibility, e.g. a Data Protection Manager). The DPO’s contact details are provided to users and regulators. The DPO is responsible for monitoring Srenova’s compliance, advising on obligations, training staff, and being involved in projects to ensure privacy by design. The DPO also serves as the contact point for data subjects and supervisory authorities. In the UK, our DPO liaises with the ICO; in France, with the CNIL, and cooperates in any investigations or consultations.
- **Privacy by Design and Default**: Srenova integrates data protection considerations at the early stages of projects and system designs. We conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (also known as Data Protection Impact Assessments, DPIAs) for any new processing that may be high risk. For instance, if we planned to implement a new automated profiling algorithm for investors or integrate a new extensive data source, we would carry out a DPIA to identify and mitigate privacy risks before launching. Our default settings favor privacy – for example, user profiles are not public by default; information sharing between users is limited until necessary; and we collect only data that we actually need for the service.
- **Policies and Training**: In addition to this GDPR Policy, we have internal policies on data handling, security, retention, and incident response. All employees must read and acknowledge these. We provide training at onboarding and annually thereafter, including specialized training for teams like developers (on secure coding and data minimisation) and customer support (on authentication of callers and handling rights requests properly). We keep records of training completion.
- **Vendor Management**: As noted, we have processes for selecting and managing third-party processors. This falls under accountability – we ensure our suppliers are compliant, and we keep copies of all data processing agreements. We also monitor sub-processors they use. If a processor fails to meet requirements, we have clauses allowing us to audit them or even terminate the relationship.
- **Audits and Monitoring**: Srenova periodically audits its data protection compliance. This could be internal audits or external ones. We review things like: are we adhering to retention schedules; are access controls working (e.g. no unauthorized staff accessing data); are consent records properly kept for those processing that require consent; and are past subject requests and breaches handled correctly. Any findings lead to remediation plans. We might also commission a third-party GDPR compliance assessment or penetration test of our systems for added assurance.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Data protection is not a one-time effort. Srenova’s management receives regular reports on privacy compliance (e.g. quarterly summary of any incidents, requests, upcoming regulatory changes). We stay informed of changes in law (like if the UK data reform bill alters some UK GDPR obligations, or new EDPB guidelines are issued) and update our practices accordingly. We also consider user feedback relating to privacy – if users raise concerns about how their data is used, we examine if changes are needed.
- **EU Representative**:  If Srenova did not have an establishment in the EU, GDPR would require us to appoint an EU Representative. However, since we operate in France, we have an EU establishment and thus handle EU individuals’ data under the oversight of CNIL directly, making a representative unnecessary. If this situation changes (e.g. if we ceased the France operation but continued serving EU customers), we would duly appoint an EU representative in an EU member state and inform users per Article 27.
- **Supervisory Authority Engagement**: We recognize the ICO as our lead authority for the UK, and the CNIL as our main EU authority (assuming France is where our EU operations are centred). We will cooperate fully with these regulators. Should we undertake any particularly risky processing, we would consult with them if required (Article 36 consultation for prior consultation in case a DPIA indicates high residual risk). We also file any registrations or pay any fees if required by national law (the UK, for example, has a fee requirement for the Data Protection fee to ICO).

By having these governance measures, Srenova can demonstrate compliance at any time – an essential requirement under GDPR. We understand that mere words are not enough; we keep evidence (like meeting minutes, policy documents, training logs, technical specs) to show what we are doing in practice. In the event of an audit or investigation, this documentation will be crucial. Moreover, this strong governance culture helps prevent issues and ensures all team members understand that data protection is a core organizational value, not an afterthought.

## UK and EU Jurisdiction Considerations

Because Srenova conducts business in both the UK and the EU (France), we ensure compliance with both regulatory regimes and acknowledge their similarities and minor differences:

- **UK GDPR and EU GDPR Alignment**: Currently, the UK GDPR is essentially the EU GDPR as retained in UK law, so the substantive rules we follow are largely the same in both jurisdictions. We monitor any divergence; if the UK introduces changes through the Data Protection Act or new regulations, we will implement those while still adhering to the EU GDPR for EU data. Our policies are designed to meet the stricter or more comprehensive requirement where laws diverge. For instance, if one regime requires something extra, we apply it across the board for consistency.
- **Supervisory Authorities**: Srenova’s lead authority in the UK is the ICO, and in France it is the CNIL. In case of a cross-border issue involving EU data subjects in multiple countries, we would likely cooperate through the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism (for example, CNIL as lead with cooperation of other EU DSAs if needed). We ensure to respond to any inquiries or enforcement actions from either authority promptly.
- **French National Requirements**: We are aware of French-specific data protection rules (e.g. France’s Data Protection Act complements GDPR). For example, France has specific requirements for processing national identification numbers, and direct marketing by electronic means is also governed by the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code. Srenova ensures that, in France, it complies with such local nuances (like obtaining consent for cookies via a CNIL-compliant banner, and handling any data related to French persons with due regard to local guidelines from CNIL).
- **Other EU jurisdictions**: If Srenova’s user base extends beyond France to other EU countries, we will ensure to accommodate any mandatory local law differences (e.g. Germany’s slight variations on employee data processing, etc.). However, since the question specifically mentions France, we focus on UK and France primarily.
- **Data Subject Rights – Forum**: We acknowledge that EU residents can exercise their GDPR rights through their local supervisory authority or courts. Our Terms (in the separate document) specify UK law and courts for contractual disputes, but data protection rights are statutory and individuals can choose to go through EU authorities regardless. We do not contest the jurisdiction of an EU supervisory authority on data protection matters where applicable – for example, CNIL has jurisdiction for French data subjects, and we will abide by that.
- **Representations and Contracts**: In our external documents (Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions), we clearly state the company’s identity and address in UK and mention any EU establishment. We provide contact details that work internationally (including an EU-based contact for EU users). Our contracts (with users or vendors) include GDPR-compliant clauses referencing both UK and EU law as needed (for instance, our DPA with a processor might refer to compliance with “UK and/or EU GDPR as applicable”).
- **Cross-Border Cooperation**: Internally, our UK and EU teams coordinate on data protection. If, say, a French user makes a data subject request, even if our main operations team is in the UK, we treat it with equal priority and respond in the appropriate language if needed. If the CNIL were to inspect our French operations, we would leverage the same compliance infrastructure used for ICO – again ensuring consistency.

In summary, Srenova treats data protection law as a unified set of principles that we apply throughout our operations, with attention to any national specifics. Whether a user is in London or Paris, they receive the same level of protection and respect for their privacy rights. Our commitment is to be fully compliant in all jurisdictions we operate in, avoiding any regulatory blind spots.
## Review and Updates of Policy

This GDPR Data Protection Policy is a living document. Srenova will review it at least annually, and additionally whenever significant changes occur in our processing activities or applicable law. Reviews are led by the Data Protection Officer in consultation with relevant departments (Legal, IT, Operations). If improvements or changes are identified (for example, due to a new service feature or a new guidance from the ICO/CNIL), we will update the policy accordingly.
Any updates to this policy will be approved by senior management to ensure top-level commitment. We maintain version control with effective dates. The latest version of the policy is made accessible to all employees (e.g. on our intranet or shared drive) and key external stakeholders as needed (we may also choose to publish a summary or the full policy on our website for transparency to partners or to satisfy due diligence of enterprise clients).
Where changes in this policy affect how we handle personal data in practice, Srenova will also reflect those changes in our external-facing Privacy Policy for users and, if necessary, notify users (for material changes). For instance, if we decided to start collecting a new type of personal data or engage a new category of processor, both this internal policy and the external privacy notice would be updated.

**Enforcement**: Adherence to this policy is mandatory. Srenova will take appropriate action in cases of non-compliance by employees or contractors – this could include retraining, disciplinary measures, or termination depending on severity. We audit compliance with this policy periodically. Each department head is responsible for ensuring their team follows the practices laid out here (e.g. HR for staff data, IT for security standards, etc.).

**Contacts and Queries**: If any employee or contractor has questions about this policy or their responsibilities, they should contact the Data Protection Officer for guidance. Similarly, if any partner (e.g. an estate agency working with us) has concerns about data protection, we will address them in line with this policy. Being “litigation-grade,” this policy can be used as evidence of our commitment and procedures in the event of any legal scrutiny or proceedings, and we stand by the commitments made herein.

In conclusion, Srenova is dedicated to protecting personal data and upholding the highest standards of privacy. By following this GDPR Policy, we ensure trust with our users and compliance with UK and EU data protection laws, thereby reducing risks to individuals and to our company. This policy has been approved at the highest level of the company, and all staff are expected to know and implement its contents.
