    "question": "What is Srenova's viager programme?",
    "answer": "Srenova offers a modernised version of the traditional French viager system. It allows you to sell your property at a discounted price while retaining the right to live in it for life. You receive a lump sum payment upfront plus a guaranteed monthly income (annuity), with no debt or interest accumulating.",

    "subsection": null,
    "question": "How is this different from traditional equity release?",
    "answer": "Unlike traditional equity release where you take on debt, with Srenova's viager programme you actually sell your home. You receive a lump sum payment upfront plus a lifetime monthly income, with no debt or interest accumulating. You maintain the right to live in your home for life, and the property is transferred to buyers who only receive full possession after you no longer need it.",

    "subsection": null,
    "question": "How does the payment structure work?",
    "answer": "When selling through Srenova, your property is purchased at a fixed 80% of the market value. The payment is structured as: * 30% of the purchase price is paid upfront as a lump sum (bouquet) * The remaining balance is paid in monthly annuity instalments over 15-20 years (for a minimum of 10 years or until your passing) * You retain lifetime residency rights in your home",

  {
    "section": "Financial Considerations",
    "subsection": null,
    "question": "How much of my property value can I access?",
    "answer": "You can typically receive around 80% of your property's current market value, with 30% paid as an immediate lump sum and the remaining value provided as a lifetime monthly payment. The specific amount depends on your property value, your age, and other individual factors.",
    "vector": null
  },
  {
    "section": "Financial Considerations",
    "subsection": null,
    "question": "How are the monthly payments calculated?",
    "answer": "Monthly payments are typically calculated as a portion of the remaining property value after the initial lump sum, adjusted for your age and life expectancy. For example, if your property is worth £500,000, you might receive £150,000 upfront and then receive monthly payments for the remainder.",

    "section": "Financial Considerations",

  {
    "section": "Financial Considerations",

    "question": "What happens if I pass away shortly after signing?",

    "question": "Can I adjust the balance between the lump sum and monthly payments?",

    "answer": "Srenova charges a total setup fee of £500, paid in two stages: * £25 to complete a property search and enable us to give you the best offer * £475 to begin the process once you're satisfied with the offer. All other costs, including transaction management fees, platform service fees, and maintenance fees, are paid by the buyer, not you.",

Taking in a lodger may be permitted with prior notification, but commercial activities like regular Airbnb rentals would typically require explicit permission.",
