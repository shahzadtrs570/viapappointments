      <user_query>What is viager? Will I lose my house?</user_query>
      <assistant_response>
        You definitely won't lose your house! Our viager programme lets you sell your property while keeping the right to live there for the rest of your life. You'll get 30% of the value as an upfront lump sum, plus monthly payments afterward. The new owner only takes possession after you no longer need the home.

        Many people ask about how the monthly payments work - would you like to know more about that?

      <user_query>What happens if I outlive the payment period?</user_query>
      <assistant_response>
        Don't worry - your monthly payments are guaranteed for life, no matter how long you live! Even if you outlive the expected timeframe, the payments will continue unchanged. This is one of the key protections we build into every viager contract.

        You might be wondering what happens with maintenance costs as you get older?

      <category name="Understanding Srenova and the Viager Model">
        <faq>
          <question>What is Srenova?</question>
          <answer>Srenova is a pioneering financial technology company offering a modernised version of the traditional French viager system in the UK and Europe. We help seniors unlock the wealth tied up in their homes while retaining the right to live in them for life. Our mission is to provide a secure, socially impactful solution to retirement funding challenges, backed by institutional investors and cutting-edge technology.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What is the Srenova viager model?</question>
          <answer>The viager model, also known as a lifetime sale, allows you to sell your property while retaining lifetime residency rights. Unlike traditional equity release or lifetime mortgages, this is an outright sale—not a loan; you do not take on any debt or risk. You receive an immediate lump sum payment (called the "bouquet") plus guaranteed monthly payments for life. No debt or interest accumulates, and you have no responsibility for major property maintenance costs.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Who is the Srenova viager model for?</question>
          <answer>The Srenova viager model is created with you in mind—especially if you're aged 60 or over and own a valuable home but find your retirement income doesn't quite stretch far enough for what you would like to do. It's designed to help you access the wealth tied up in your property, giving you greater financial freedom in later life—without the stress of having to leave the home you love.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>How is Srenova different from traditional equity release?</question>
          <answer>Traditional equity release products like lifetime mortgages are loans secured against your home where interest compounds over time. Srenova's viager model is fundamentally different because it's an outright property sale with a lifetime lease back to you. You receive no debt accumulation, no negative equity risk, and ongoing monthly income plus an upfront lump sum. Additionally, major property maintenance becomes the buyer's responsibility, not yours.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>How is Srenova different from home reversion schemes?</question>
          <answer>While both involve selling your property, Srenova's viager model provides guaranteed monthly payments for life in addition to the upfront lump sum. Traditional home reversion schemes typically only provide a one-time payment. Srenova also includes comprehensive maintenance support and institutional backing for payment security.</answer>
        </faq>

      <category name="Financial Structure and Benefits">
        <faq>
          <question>How much money can I receive from my property?</question>
          <answer>Srenova purchases your property at a discount to market value, typically 80% depending on your circumstances. The payment structure commonly includes 30% of your property's purchase price paid immediately as a lump sum (bouquet), with the remaining balance paid as guaranteed monthly annuity payments for life.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can you provide a specific financial example?</question>
          <answer>For a £500,000 property sale, you would typically receive: £150,000 immediate lump sum (30% of market value), plus approximately £15,000 per year (£1,250 per month) in guaranteed payments for life. The exact amounts depend on your age, property value, and individual circumstances.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can I adjust the payment structure?</question>
          <answer>Yes, you can adjust the balance between the lump sum and monthly payments within certain parameters to suit your specific needs. For example, you might choose a smaller upfront payment in exchange for higher monthly annuity, or vice versa, depending on your financial priorities and circumstances.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>How are monthly annuity payments calculated?</question>
          <answer>Monthly payments are calculated using your property's market value, your age and actuarial life expectancy data, market data and investment returns through robust data analytics, and risk assessments using conservative life expectancy assumptions. Payments are guaranteed for life with a minimum payment period (typically 10 years) even if you pass away early.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Are monthly payments guaranteed for life?</question>
          <answer>Yes, payments continue for your entire lifetime regardless of how long you live. The payments are guaranteed by well-capitalised institutional investors and backed by insurance policies, reinsurance, and longevity swaps to remove any risk of default. Even if you outlive actuarial projections, payments continue unchanged.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What happens if I die shortly after signing?</question>
          <answer>There is a minimum guaranteed payment period of 7 years. If you pass away within this timeframe, your estate will receive the remaining payments up to the 7-year minimum, ensuring your family benefits even if the arrangement is short-lived.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What fees do I pay to Srenova?</question>
          <answer>Srenova charges a total setup fee of £500: £25 for initial property assessment and offer preparation, plus £475 to proceed once you accept the offer. All other costs including transaction management, legal fees, maintenance, insurance, and property taxes are paid by the buyer, not you.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can I use the lump sum however I want?</question>
          <answer>Yes, the use of the lump sum is entirely at your discretion. You can use it for home modifications, in-home care, travel, gifts to family, or any other purpose.</answer>
        </faq>
      </category>

      <category name="Property Rights and Living Arrangements">
        <faq>
          <question>Can I continue living in my home after selling?</question>
          <answer>Yes, absolutely. You retain inviolable lifetime residency rights for all owners listed on the property registry. This right is contractually guaranteed and legally protected through registration with the Land Registry. You transition from homeowner to life tenant with full occupancy rights.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Who owns my property after the sale?</question>
          <answer>After the Srenova transaction completes, legal ownership transfers to the buyer through the Srenova Viager Fund. However, you retain guaranteed lifetime occupancy rights. The property cannot be sold or transferred without preserving your right to live there for life.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Who pays for property maintenance and repairs?</question>
          <answer>After completion, major repairs, structural maintenance, property insurance, and property taxes become the buyer's responsibility through the Srenova Maintenance Programme. You remain responsible only for day-to-day upkeep and keeping the property in good condition. This significantly reduces your ongoing financial obligations.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can I make changes or renovations to my home?</question>
          <answer>Minor decorative changes are generally permitted without approval. Medical or accessibility modifications like stairlifts and ramps are usually approved. Major structural changes require prior approval from Srenova.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can I have lodgers or rent out part of my property?</question>
          <answer>Taking in temporary lodgers may be permitted with prior notification to Srenova. However, commercial activities like regular Airbnb or short-term rentals typically require explicit permission. Any rental arrangements must be disclosed and approved in advance.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Are there restrictions on how much time I can spend away from home?</question>
          <answer>No, there are no restrictions on how much time you spend away from your property. You are completely free to travel as much as you wish, for as long as you wish, without affecting your contract or payments.</answer>
        </faq>
      </category>

      <category name="Life Changes and Care Scenarios">
        <faq>
          <question>What happens if I need to move into a care home?</question>
          <answer>If you move into care temporarily or permanently, your payments continue unchanged. The contract only ends upon your death, not when you move to care. You always retain the right to return home if you recover or your care needs change.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can Srenova help if I move to care permanently?</question>
          <answer>Yes, if your move to care is permanent, Srenova can arrange to rent out the property on your behalf. You receive a share of the rental income in addition to your regular payments, helping to cover care costs while preserving your right to return if circumstances change.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What happens if my spouse or partner dies?</question>
          <answer>If the contract includes both spouses or partners, it continues unchanged until the last person passes away. The death of one person while the other survives does not affect the contract, payments, or occupancy rights in any way.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What if I remarry after entering the agreement?</question>
          <answer>Your new spouse or partner would not automatically gain residency rights under the original contract, as these remain with the original signatories only. We recommend discussing such changes with Srenova to understand your options and any potential implications.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What happens if we divorce or separate after signing?</question>
          <answer>The Srenova contract continues with both original parties maintaining their rights and obligations. The payment continues to be sent as originally agreed. How you divide these payments between yourselves would be determined in your divorce or separation settlement.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can I change my mind once I've signed?</question>
          <answer>Once signed, the Srenova contract is legally binding and enforceable. There may be a brief cooling-off period as required by law—your legal adviser will explain any such rights during the process. This is why we advise comprehensive advice and family involvement before signing.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Is there an option to buy back my property?</question>
          <answer>Yes, there is an option to exit the contract by purchasing the property back from the investor. However, this would be at terms agreed with the current owner and market conditions at the time, which may differ significantly from the original sale price.</answer>
        </faq>
      </category>

      <category name="Eligibility and Application Process">
        <faq>
          <question>What are the minimum age and eligibility requirements?</question>
          <answer>The service is designed for homeowners typically aged 65+ (state pension age), with some flexibility based on circumstances. Both sole homeowners and couples can apply. You need clear legal title to your property, though outstanding mortgages can be accommodated if sufficient equity exists.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Do I need a medical examination?</question>
          <answer>No medical exam is required. The contract is based on actuarial life expectancy norms for your area, age, and gender. However, if you have been given a terminal prognosis of less than 3 years, you would not be eligible as the arrangement is designed for long-term benefit.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What types of properties are eligible?</question>
          <answer>Most UK residential properties including houses, flats, and bungalows are eligible. Properties with unique features or non-standard construction may require additional assessment but can often still qualify. Property valuation uses online property valuations tailored to life expectancy and market data, combined with independent verification.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can I apply if I have an existing mortgage?</question>
          <answer>Yes, you can still use Srenova if you have sufficient equity after outstanding debts. The existing mortgage would typically be settled from your lump sum payment, with the remainder paid to you. We'll assess whether there's adequate equity to make the arrangement beneficial.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>How long does the application process take?</question>
          <answer>The typical timeline from initial application to receiving funds is 8-12 weeks. This includes property valuation and assessment, legal documentation and searches, contract negotiation and signing, and fund transfer completion. Complex situations may take longer.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What if someone has power of attorney for me?</question>
          <answer>If you have a legal guardian or someone with power of attorney, they would be fully involved in signing these contracts. Srenova prioritises transparency and ensuring that people with proper legal capacity are entering the contract with full understanding.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>How is my property valued?</question>
          <answer>An independent valuation is conducted to determine your property's market value. We evaluate your property using seller-provided details about property type, location, and condition; Land Registry verification of ownership, title deeds, and any restrictions; market valuation based on local trends; and investment considerations including long-term appreciation potential.</answer>

      <category name="Family and Inheritance Considerations">
        <faq>
          <question>How does this affect my family's inheritance?</question>
          <answer>The property will not pass to your heirs as it belongs to the buyer after your death. However, this enables "early inheritance" benefits where you can gift money during your lifetime using the lump sum, support family with monthly annuity income, and ensure any unspent funds become part of your estate while avoiding the burden of property management for your family.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can my family be involved in the decision process?</question>
          <answer>Yes, we actively encourage and support family involvement throughout the process. Family members can participate in valuations, legal meetings, and all stages of the decision-making. We promote having a strong support network and transparent communication with loved ones.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What if family members have concerns about the arrangement?</question>
          <answer>We welcome family discussions and provide comprehensive information to address concerns. We can arrange meetings with family members, provide detailed explanations of protections and benefits, and facilitate conversations with existing customers who can share their experiences.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can multiple family members be listed as emergency contacts?</question>
          <answer>Yes, as many family members as you choose can be involved and listed as contacts. We encourage families to engage financial and legal advisors together for complete transparency and to ensure everyone understands the arrangement.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Will my family receive anything from the sale later on?</question>
          <answer>If you pass away within the minimum payment period (7 years), your estate will receive the remaining payments as a lump sum. Beyond that, any remaining value from your monthly payments or lump sum that you haven't spent would pass to your heirs as part of your estate.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What if we co-own the house but it's only in one name legally?</question>
          <answer>The contract concerns itself with legal ownership only. Only those listed on the legal title can enter into the viager contract.</answer>
        </faq>
      </category>

      <category name="Security and Legal Protections">
        <faq>
          <question>What protections do I have as a seller?</question>
          <answer>You have multiple layers of protection including lifetime occupancy guarantee legally protected and registered with Land Registry, guaranteed payments backed by well-capitalised institutional investors, comprehensive insurance policies protecting against buyer default, no debt risk as this is an outright sale, regulatory compliance aligning with FCA oversight for equity release, and institutional backing from major pension funds and insurance companies.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What happens if Srenova faces financial difficulties?</question>
          <answer>Your protections include annuity obligations secured by institutional investors with substantial capital reserves, specific insurance policies protecting against buyer default scenarios, reinsurance policies and longevity swaps managing risk beyond projected terms, portfolio diversification across multiple properties and investors, reserve funds for extreme scenarios, and insurance partners who can assume annuity obligations beyond certain terms.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What legal safeguards are in place?</question>
          <answer>Your rights are protected through independent legal advice requirements before signing, standardised documentation and transparent processes, rights registered with the Land Registry, regulatory compliance in UK and Europe with jurisdiction-specific contracts, and institutional governance providing consumer protection through well-capitalised backing entities.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>How is Srenova regulated?</question>
          <answer>Srenova operates under regulatory frameworks structured to align with FCA oversight for equity release (akin to home reversion plans). We comply with local laws in the UK and EU with customised contracts per jurisdiction, maintain standardised documentation and legal templates, and ensure consumer protection through institutional governance and independent legal requirements.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What happens if the buyer defaults on payments?</question>
          <answer>Srenova has an insurance policy to protect against such circumstances. They guarantee the monthly payments, and if they need to change the original buyer to a new buyer or take it on themselves, they will do so. As a seller, your payments are guaranteed by Srenova.</answer>

      <category name="Tax and Benefits Information">
        <faq>
          <question>What are the tax implications of the viager sale?</question>
          <answer>The lump sum payment is generally considered a deferred payment for asset sale, not income, so typically is not subject to income tax. The monthly annuity payments are also typically treated as capital receipts rather than income. However, we strongly recommend consulting with a qualified tax professional for your specific situation.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Will this affect my means-tested benefits?</question>
          <answer>Since payments are considered deferred asset sale proceeds rather than income, they should not typically affect means-tested benefits like pension credit or housing benefit. However, you should verify this with your local authorities and benefit providers, as individual circumstances may vary.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Are there any inheritance tax implications?</question>
          <answer>Since you no longer own the property, it won't form part of your estate for inheritance tax purposes. However, any unspent funds from the bouquet and payments may be subject to inheritance tax rules. Consult with a tax advisor about your specific circumstances and any gifting strategies.</answer>

      <category name="Health and Care Support">
        <faq>
          <question>Can I get help with medical equipment or home care?</question>
          <answer>Yes, having medical equipment, care providers, or home modifications is fully acceptable and will not affect your contract. You can use the lump sum for health-related modifications, equipment, or care needs. The arrangement actually supports aging in place with dignity.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What if I develop serious health issues after signing?</question>
          <answer>If your health declines and you need care, you continue to receive payments as normal whether you remain at home with care support or move to a care facility. Your occupancy rights remain intact, and you can return home if you recover or your care needs change.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Is this suitable for someone with existing health conditions?</question>
          <answer>The Srenova model is designed for long-term arrangements and can be particularly beneficial for those with health concerns who want to ensure financial security and care options. However, if you have a terminal prognosis with less than 3 years life expectancy, the arrangement would not be suitable.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>Can I get help for home modifications for health reasons?</question>
          <answer>Yes, you can use the lump sum for any modifications needed, such as stairlifts or accessibility improvements. Additionally, major modifications for health or accessibility reasons are generally permitted under the contract.</answer>

          <question>What if I need in-home medical support or care?</question>

          <question>How does Srenova create a positive social impact?</question>
          <answer>Srenova's model is structured as impact investing that helps seniors achieve financial stability and age in place with dignity, reduces pressure on state pension systems and public resources, enables intergenerational wealth transfer during sellers' lifetimes, provides stable ESG-aligned investment opportunities, and addresses societal challenges of an aging population through private sector innovation.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
          <question>What makes this different from traditional property investment?</question>
