Before you start thinking ensure I have a clear goal, if not ask the for the goal/objective.

# 1 Goal Definitaion
Goal: 


# 2 Understand the codebase
Important: Before we start any thinking or responsding to the goal, I want you to fully explore and understand the existing codebase. Don't write code yetâ€”just deeply understand what's currently happening. To ensure you fully understands the context first.

# 3 Thinking about the goal
Now, spend at least 10 minutes deeply reasoning about how a world-class engineer would approach solving this. Generate ideas, critique them, refine your thinking, and then propose an excellent final plan. 

Create a temporary implemntation and progress tracking plan in a `temp/<goal>.md` file so that the user can review and the implementation can be split across multiple sessions if needed.

I'll approve or request changes.

# User feedback and next steps
If the user responds change, then edit your plan
If the user responds implement, then implement the plan
