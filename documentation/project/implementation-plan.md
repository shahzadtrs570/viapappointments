# Srenova Implementation Plan

## Introduction

This implementation plan outlines the steps to build Srenova using the NextJet SaaS starter kit. The project requirements and specifications are detailed in the following documents:

- [project-requirements-document.md] - Core project requirements and specifications
- [app-flow.md] - User flows and application navigation
- [data-schema.md] - Database schema and data model specifications
- [marketing-site-content.md] - Marketing site content and structure
- [colour-theme.md] - Project color palette and theming guidelines
- [ux-considerations.md] - User experience and interface requirements

This plan focuses exclusively on the technical implementation steps required to customize and extend NextJet to meet the project requirements specified in those documents.

Ensure you work on one phase at a time, ensuring these are completed before the next one is started unless you are blocked. Always check the dependencies before starting a new phase or task to ensure that the dependencies are completed otherwise you will not be able to complete the task.
