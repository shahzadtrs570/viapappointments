# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

The backend is the invisible engine that makes our platform dynamic and reliable. It is designed to support a diverse set of users, from regular end-users to administrators. The backend handles all data management, user authentication, content management, and interactions, ensuring that when you use the platform, everything works smoothly behind the scenes. It is built with scalability, security, and performance in mind so that as more users join, the platform keeps running efficiently.

## Backend Architecture

The backend architecture is built around a modern, service-oriented structure using a monorepo approach. It relies on Prisma as the database ORM, tRPC for type-safe APIs, and Auth.js for authentication. Our design leverages a clear separation of concerns organized into specialized packages:

- **api**: Contains tRPC routers and procedures that define our API endpoints
- **auth**: Manages authentication logic and session handling
- **db**: Houses Prisma schema and database migrations
- **email**: Handles email template rendering and delivery through Resend
- **payments**: Integrates payment solutions (Stripe or Lemon Squeezy)

This organization supports scalability as the platform grows, ensuring that additional features can be integrated without massive overhauls. The architecture follows a feature-based folder structure within each application, making it easy to locate and maintain related code.

## Database Management

At the core of the database management strategy is Prisma, which provides a reliable and secure database solution with support for various database systems. The database schema is carefully designed with clearly defined models and relationships, ensuring that data retrieval and management are both efficient and straightforward.

Key models in the schema include:
- User model with role-based permissions
- Subscription model for payment tracking
- Various content-related models specific to the application needs

The platform uses database migrations for version control of the schema, allowing for safe and consistent updates across development and production environments. Regular backups and data validation checks are part of our routine to ensure the integrity of the stored information.

### Schema Implementation Verification Checklist

When implementing or modifying database schemas, API routes, or data validations, verify:

#### Before Implementation
- [ ] Checked for existence of `documentation/project/data-schema.md`
- [ ] Read and understood the schema specifications
- [ ] Identified exactly which models/tables need to be implemented
- [ ] Acknowledge that the `documentation/project/data-schema.md` should be used to extend the original prisma schema, this means not removing any existing feilds unless told to do so, you can ask for clariffication from the user if unsure.

#### During Implementation
- [ ] Following the exact Prisma schema structure defined in the document
- [ ] Not adding any fields or relationships not specified
- [ ] Not creating any tables not explicitly defined
- [ ] Check you are not removing any fileds that would break the existing functionality
- [ ] Using the specified data types, constraints, and relationships

#### After Implementation
- [ ] Verified every table created exists in the data-schema.md document
- [ ] Verified every field implemented is specified in the corresponding schema
- [ ] Verified you have not removed any fileds that would break the existing functionality
- [ ] Verified no additional tables or fields have been added
- [ ] Confirmed all relationships match the defined schema

## Infrastructure Components

The infrastructure is a combination of several components working in harmony. The monorepo structure powered by Turborepo ensures efficient builds and clear separation of concerns. For production environments, we utilize:

- Automatic scaling to handle varying loads
- CDN integration for faster content delivery
- Edge functions for improved response times
- Serverless architecture to reduce operational complexity
- Background processing using the [Queue system](../template/guide/queue.md)
- File storage across multiple providers ([File Storage documentation](../template/guide/file_storage.md))
- Comprehensive logging system ([Logger documentation](../template/guide/logger.md))
- AI integrations for enhanced functionality:
  - [API Usage Tracking](../template/guide/ai_api_calls.md)
  - [LLM Integration](../template/guide/ai_llm.md)
  - [Audio Processing](../template/guide/ai_audio.md)
- Email delivery system ([Email documentation](../template/guide/email.md))

These components come together to ensure that the backend remains responsive and dependable at all times, even as user numbers grow.

## API Design and Endpoints

The platform utilizes tRPC for end-to-end type-safe APIs, ensuring easy and predictable communication between the frontend and backend. This approach eliminates the need for manual API documentation and reduces the risk of runtime errors due to type mismatches.

API routers are organized into logical groups, with each group handling related functionalities. Protected procedures ensure that authenticated users can only access appropriate resources, while public procedures manage publicly available data. The API design includes robust error handling and validation using Zod schemas, guaranteeing that every action is managed in a consistent and secure manner.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is designed to be deployed on various cloud platforms, with Vercel being the recommended option due to its seamless integration with Next.js. The platform can also be deployed to alternatives like Netlify or AWS Amplify. By leveraging these cloud-based environments, we benefit from increased reliability and less downtime.

The deployment process is streamlined with clear documentation for database setup, domain configuration, and environment variable management. This approach ensures that updates can be rolled out quickly and securely, with minimal disruption to users.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that the backend remains robust, the platform integrates with monitoring and analytics tools. System performance can be tracked through Tinybird analytics, providing insights into usage patterns and potential bottlenecks. 

Database migrations are managed through Prisma's tooling with convenient npm scripts:

```bash
# Create a new migration
pnpm db:migrate

# Apply pending migrations
pnpm db:deploy

# Reset database
pnpm db:reset
```

This proactive approach to monitoring and maintenance minimizes downtime and maintains a smooth user experience for all platform interactions.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend is designed to be a resilient, scalable, and secure foundation for the platform. By using a modern monorepo architecture with integrated services like Prisma, tRPC, and Auth.js, this backend manages everything from data storage and user authentication to payment processing and performance monitoring.

Every component of this setup has been chosen to offer high reliability and efficiency, keeping the platform running smoothly as it scales. The thoughtful design not only meets current needs but also provides flexibility for future growth, making it an excellent foundation for building robust SaaS applications.
