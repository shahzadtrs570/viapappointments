# Srenova FAQ

# **Comprehensive FAQ**

## **Understanding the Viager Model**

### **What is Srenova's viager programme?**

Srenova offers a modernised version of the traditional French viager system. It allows you to sell your property at a discounted price while retaining the right to live in it for life. You receive a lump sum payment upfront plus a guaranteed monthly income (annuity), with no debt or interest accumulating.

### **How is this different from traditional equity release?**

Unlike traditional equity release where you take on debt, with Srenova's viager programme you actually sell your home. You receive a lump sum payment upfront plus a lifetime monthly income, with no debt or interest accumulating. You maintain the right to live in your home for life, and the property is transferred to buyers who only receive full possession after you no longer need it.

### **How does the payment structure work?**

When selling through Srenova, your property is purchased at a fixed 80% of the market value. The payment is structured as:

* 30% of the purchase price is paid upfront as a lump sum (bouquet)  
* The remaining balance is paid in monthly annuity instalments over 15-20 years (for a minimum of 10 years or until your passing)  
* You retain lifetime residency rights in your home

### **How do you determine my offer?**

We evaluate your property using:

* Seller-provided details about property type, location, and condition  
* Land Registry verification of ownership, title deeds, and any restrictions  
* Market valuation based on local trends  
* Investment considerations including long-term appreciation potential

## **Financial Considerations**

### **How much of my property value can I access?**

You can typically receive around 80% of your property's current market value, with 30% paid as an immediate lump sum and the remaining value provided as a lifetime monthly payment. The specific amount depends on your property value, your age, and other individual factors.

### **How are the monthly payments calculated?**

Monthly payments are typically calculated as a portion of the remaining property value after the initial lump sum, adjusted for your age and life expectancy. For example, if your property is worth £500,000, you might receive £150,000 upfront and then receive monthly payments for the remainder.

### **What happens if I live longer than expected?**

Your monthly payments are guaranteed for life, regardless of how long you live. The monthly annuity continues even if you outlive the projected life expectancy used in the initial calculations.

### **What happens if I pass away shortly after signing?**

There is a minimum term of 7 years for payments. If you pass away within that time, the remaining payments up to the 7-year mark will be paid to your estate as a lump sum.

### **Can I adjust the balance between the lump sum and monthly payments?**

There may be some flexibility to adjust the ratio between your initial lump sum and the monthly payments, within certain parameters. This would be discussed during your personalised consultation to align with your specific financial needs.

### **What fees and costs are involved?**

Srenova charges a total setup fee of £500, paid in two stages:

* £25 to complete a property search and enable us to give you the best offer  
* £475 to begin the process once you're satisfied with the offer

All other costs, including transaction management fees, platform service fees, and maintenance fees, are paid by the buyer, not you.

### **Can I use the lump sum however I want?**

Yes, the use of the lump sum is entirely at your discretion. You can use it for home modifications, in-home care, travel, gifts to family, or any other purpose.

---

## **Property Rights and Residency**

### **Can I still live in my home after selling?**

Yes, you retain lifetime residency rights, meaning you can continue living in your home for the rest of your life. This applies to all owners listed on the property.

### **Who is responsible for property maintenance and repairs?**

Major repairs and structural maintenance become the responsibility of Srenova and the buyer. You remain responsible for day-to-day maintenance and keeping the property in good condition. The EstateFlex Maintenance Programme ensures you don't bear unexpected maintenance costs.

### **Can I make renovations or modify my home?**

Minor decorative changes are typically allowed. For more significant modifications, particularly for medical or accessibility purposes, these are generally permitted. Major structural changes would require approval.

### **Can I rent out all or part of my property?**

If you need to move out temporarily (e.g., for care), Srenova can help rent out the property, and you would receive some benefit from the rental income in addition to your regular payments. Taking in a lodger may be permitted with prior notification, but commercial activities like regular Airbnb rentals would typically require explicit permission.

### **What if I want to travel for extended periods?**

There are no restrictions on how much time you spend away from your property. You are free to travel as much as you wish.

## **Family and Inheritance**

### **How does this affect inheritance for my children?**

In a viager sale, the property itself will not go to your heirs; it belongs to the buyer upon your death. Your heirs would only inherit whatever assets you have left – for example, any savings from the annuity payments or bouquet if you haven't spent them.

### **Will my family receive anything from the sale later on?**

If you pass away within the minimum payment period (7 years), your estate will receive the remaining payments as a lump sum. Beyond that, any remaining value from your monthly payments or lump sum that you haven't spent would pass to your heirs as part of your estate.

### **Can family members be involved in the process?**

Yes, we actively encourage family members to be involved as much as the sellers would like them to be. They can be present during legal meetings, valuations, and throughout the process.

### **Can multiple siblings be listed as contacts?**

As many family members as you choose can be involved in the process. We encourage families to engage financial and legal advice together for complete transparency.

## **Life Changes and Circumstances**

### **What happens if one spouse/partner dies?**

If the contract is signed by a couple, it continues unchanged until the last person passes away. The passing of one person while another survives does not affect the contract or the payments in any way.

### **What if I need to move into a care home?**

If you move into a care home, the payments continue unchanged. The contract only ends on the passing of the final person in the contract. The monthly payments can help cover the cost of care. You retain the right to return to your home if you recover.

### **What if I recover and want to return home?**

You always retain the right to return to your home. If Srenova has rented the property on your behalf while you were in care, they would need to terminate that tenancy to allow you to return, which may take some time, but your right to return is guaranteed.

### **What happens if I remarry after entering the agreement?**

Your new spouse or partner would not be party to the original contract, so they would not have residency rights under the agreement. The contract remains with the original signatories only.

### **What happens if we separate or divorce?**

If you divorce after signing the contract, the contract remains in force with both original parties. The annuity payment continues to be sent to both parties, typically split 50-50 or as agreed in the contract. How this is handled would be determined as part of your divorce settlement.

### **Can I change my mind once I've signed?**

No, once signed, the viager contract is a legally enforceable contract. That's why Srenova ensures that everyone has proper advice and the right people involved in the conversation prior to signing.

### **What if I want to buy back the property?**

There is an option to exit the viager contract if you wanted to purchase the property back, but you would be buying back the property from the original buyer at whatever terms they might agree to.

## **Process and Requirements**

### **What are the minimum age requirements?**

The service is designed for homeowners at or above the state pension age, typically 65+. Both sole homeowners and couples can apply.

### **What types of properties are eligible?**

Most residential properties in the UK are eligible, including houses, flats, and bungalows. The property should be your primary residence, in good condition, and typically valued above a minimum threshold.

### **How is my property valued?**

An independent valuation is conducted to determine your property's market value. Based on this assessment, a personalised offer is structured, including an upfront deposit and a schedule of monthly payments.

### **What if I have an outstanding mortgage?**

You can still use Srenova if you have an outstanding mortgage or secured loan, provided there is sufficient equity in your property. The existing loan would typically be settled from the proceeds of your lump sum payment, with the remainder paid to you.

### **How long does the process take?**

The typical timeframe from initial application to receiving funds is 8-12 weeks, depending on the complexity of your situation, property valuation process, and legal requirements.

### **Do I need to pass a medical exam?**

Srenova does not require a medical examination. The contract is based on how long someone is expected to live under the actuarial norms of their area, age, and gender. However, if someone has been given a terminal prognosis with less than a year to live, they would not be eligible for the contract.

## **Legal and Tax Implications**

### **What tax implications should I consider?**

The lump sum payment is generally considered a deferred payment for the sale of an asset, not income, so it should not be subject to income tax. However, we always recommend consulting with a tax professional to understand your specific situation.

### **Will this affect my eligibility for means-tested benefits?**

Since the payments are considered deferred payments for the sale of an asset rather than income, they should not affect means-tested benefits. However, we always recommend checking with your local authorities and benefit providers.

### **What legal protections do I have?**

Your rights are legally protected through:

* Independent legal advice before signing  
* Clear, transparent documentation  
* Rights registered with the land registry  
* A lien on the property ensuring your protections remain regardless of ownership changes  
* FCA regulation providing consumer protection

### **What happens if Srenova or the buyer goes out of business?**

Your rights are protected by legal agreements registered against the property title. Additionally, Srenova has an insurance policy and contingency provisions to ensure continuity of your payments and residence rights even if there were business changes.

### **What happens if the buyer defaults on payments?**

Srenova has an insurance policy to protect against such circumstances. They guarantee the monthly payments, and if they need to change the original buyer to a new buyer or take it on themselves, they will do so. As a seller, your payments are guaranteed by Srenova.

## **Health and Care Considerations**

### **Can I get help for home modifications for health reasons?**

Yes, you can use the lump sum for any modifications needed, such as stairlifts or accessibility improvements. Additionally, major modifications for health or accessibility reasons are generally permitted under the contract.

### **Will this arrangement affect any care support or benefits?**

As the purchase through the viager system is a deferred payment for an asset, not an income stream, it should not affect means-tested benefits. However, we always encourage you to verify this with your local authorities.

### **What if I need in-home medical support or care?**

Srenova is supportive of people's needs. Having medical equipment or care providers in the home is perfectly acceptable and will not affect your contract.

### **What happens if I develop a serious illness after signing?**

If your health declines and you need to go into care, you continue to receive payments as normal. Your right to reside in the property remains, and you can return if you recover.

### **Is this agreement suitable for someone with serious health issues?**

The viager model is designed for long-term arrangements. If someone has been given a terminal prognosis with less than a year to live, the contract would not be suitable as there needs to be a reasonable timeframe for someone to benefit from the arrangement.

## **Specific Scenarios**

### **What if one of us is the legal guardian or has power of attorney?**

As a legal guardian or someone with power of attorney, you would be fully involved in the signing of these contracts. Srenova prioritises transparency and ensuring that the right people with proper capacity are entering the contract.

### **What if my property has unique features or non-standard construction?**

Properties with unique features or non-standard construction can still be eligible, though they may require additional assessment. These characteristics might affect the valuation and terms offered.

### **What if we co-own the house but it's only in one name legally?**

The contract concerns itself with legal ownership only. Only those listed on the legal title can enter into the viager contract.

### **Can we pause the process while considering other options?**

Prior to any contract being signed, the process can be paused at any time. Srenova is committed to ensuring that viager contracts are only entered into with transparency and complete understanding.
